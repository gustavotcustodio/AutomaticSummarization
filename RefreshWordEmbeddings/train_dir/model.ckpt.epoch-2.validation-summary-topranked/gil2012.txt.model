It has been described that environmental factors , as well as life habits , may affect semen quality .
Artificial intelligence techniques are now an emerging methodology as decision support systems in medicine .
In this paper we compare three artificial intelligence techniques , decision trees , Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines , in order to evaluate their performance in the prediction of the seminal quality from the data of the environmental factors and lifestyle .
To do that we collect data by a normalized questionnaire from young healthy volunteers and then , we use the results of a semen analysis to asses the accuracy in the prediction of the three classification methods mentioned above .
