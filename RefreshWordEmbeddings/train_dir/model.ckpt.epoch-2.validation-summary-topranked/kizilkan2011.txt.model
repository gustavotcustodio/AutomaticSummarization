For this aim , an experimental refrigeration system was designed with a frequency inverter mounted on compressor electric motor .
The experiments were made for different compressor electric motor frequencies .
Instead of several experiments , the use of ANNs had been proposed to determine the system performance parameters based on various compressor frequencies and cooling loads using results of experimental analysis .
The backpropagation learning algorithm with two different variants was used in the network .
