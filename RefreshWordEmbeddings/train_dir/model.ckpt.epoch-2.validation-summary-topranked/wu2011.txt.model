To improve the efficiency of diagnosis , several distinct tumor marker groups are combined together using a mathematical evaluation model , called artificial neural network ( ANN ) .
Lung cancer markers have been identified to include carcinoembryonic antigen , carcinoma antigen 125 , neuron specific enolase , Î²2-microglobulin , gastrin , soluble interleukin-6 receptor , sialic acid , pseudouridine , nitric oxide , and some metal ions .
The most valuable were selected into an optimal tumor marker group by multiple logistic regression analysis .
Results We have presented evidence that this system is superior to a traditional statistical method , its diagnosis specificity significantly improved from 72.0 % to 100.0 % and its accuracy increased from 71.4 % to 92.8 % .
