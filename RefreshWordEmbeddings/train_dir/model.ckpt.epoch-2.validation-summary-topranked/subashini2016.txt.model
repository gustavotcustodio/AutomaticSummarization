The proposed method takes an effort to develop a non-invasive method for the tumor grade ( Low/High ) identification using magnetic resonant images .
The process involves preprocessing , image segmentation , tumor isolation , feature extraction , feature selection and classification .
An analysis on the performance of the segmentation techniques , feature extraction methods , automatic feature selection ( SFLA ) and constructed classifiers ( support vector machines , learning vector quantization and Naives Bayes ) is done on the basis of accuracy , efficiency and elapsed time .
This analysis motivates towards the accurate determination of tumor grade from MR images instead of depending on magnetic resonant spectroscopy and biopsy .
