Lung cancer is a public health priority worldwide due to the high mortality rate and the costs involved .
In recent years serum biomarkers have been proposed as a method that might enhance diagnostic capabilities and complement imaging studies .
However , it has become clear that a universal biomarker panel does not exist , and optimized panels need to be developed and validated in each population before their application in a clinical setting .
This panel was able to correctly classify 135 out of 150 subjects , showing a correct classification rate for lung cancer patients of 88.9 % , 93.3 % and 90 % in training , validation and testing phases , respectively .
