Many audio signal applications are corrupted by noise .
Recent work provides that there exist some insights on using an artificial intelligence method called artificial hydrocarbon networks ( AHNs ) for filtering audio signals .
Thus , the scope of this paper is to design and implement a novel approach of artificial hydrocarbon networks on adaptive filtering for audio signals .
One of the problems in audio signal applications is the addition of noise signals that interfere with the original ones arriving in poor performance of audio .
