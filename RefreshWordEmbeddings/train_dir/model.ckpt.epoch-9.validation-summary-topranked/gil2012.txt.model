It has been described that environmental factors , as well as life habits , may affect semen quality .
Artificial intelligence techniques are now an emerging methodology as decision support systems in medicine .
To do that we collect data by a normalized questionnaire from young healthy volunteers and then , we use the results of a semen analysis to asses the accuracy in the prediction of the three classification methods mentioned above .
The results show that Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines show the highest accuracy , with prediction accuracy values of 86 % for some of the seminal parameters .
