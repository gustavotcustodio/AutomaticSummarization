Image thresholding is a process for separating interesting objects within an image from their background .
An optimal threshold â€™ s selection can be regarded as a single objective optimization problem , where obtaining a solution can be computationally expensive and time-consuming , especially when the number of thresholds increases greatly .
This paper proposes a novel hybrid differential evolution algorithm for selecting the optimal threshold values for a given gray-level input image , using the criterion defined by Otsu .
Additionally a study of different evolutionary or swarm-based intelligence algorithms for the purpose of thresholding , with a higher number of thresholds was performed , since many real-world applications require more than just a few thresholds for further processing .
