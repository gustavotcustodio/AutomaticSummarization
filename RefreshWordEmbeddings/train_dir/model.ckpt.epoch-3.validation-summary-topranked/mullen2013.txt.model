This paper extends on previous work in applying an ant algorithm to image feature extraction , focusing on edge pattern extraction , as well as the broader study of self-organisation mechanisms in digital image environments .
A novel method of distributed adaptive thresholding is introduced to the ant algorithm , which enables automated distributed adaptive thresholding across the swarm .
This technique is shown to increase performance of the algorithm , and furthermore , eliminates the requirement for a user set threshold , allowing the algorithm to autonomously adapt an appropriate threshold for a given image , or data set .
This paper reports research into the application of swarm intelligence to image feature extraction , and specifically , the use of an ant-algorithm approach based on the original Ant System ( AS ) ( Dorigo & Gambardella , 1997 ) .
