Permeability prediction has been a challenge to reservoir engineers due to the lack of tools that measure it directly .
The most reliable data of permeability obtained from laboratory measurements on cores do not provide a continuous profile along the depth of the formation .
Recently , researchers utilized statistical regression , neural networks , and fuzzy logic to estimate both permeability and porosity from well logs .
This paper presents functional networks as a novel approach to forecast permeability using well logs in a carbonate reservoir .
