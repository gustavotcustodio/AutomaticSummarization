Lung cancer is a public health priority worldwide due to the high mortality rate and the costs involved .
Early detection of lung cancer is important for increasing the survival rate , however , frequently its diagnosis is not made opportunely , since detection methods are not sufficiently sensitive and specific .

Recent reports have shown that simultaneous analysis of biomarkers has the potential to separate lung cancer patients from control subjects .
