The proposed method takes an effort to develop a non-invasive method for the tumor grade ( Low/High ) identification using magnetic resonant images .
The process involves preprocessing , image segmentation , tumor isolation , feature extraction , feature selection and classification .
Fuzzy c-means segmentation outperformed other segmentation techniques , shape and size based textural feature promoted the demarcation of tumor grades , Naive Bayes classifier succeeded in terms of efficiency , error and elapse time when compared with SVM and LVQ .
The study was carried out with 200 images consisting training set ( 164 images ) and testing set ( 36 images ) .
