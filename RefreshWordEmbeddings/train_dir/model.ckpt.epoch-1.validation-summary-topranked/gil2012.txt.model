It has been described that environmental factors , as well as life habits , may affect semen quality .
Artificial intelligence techniques are now an emerging methodology as decision support systems in medicine .
The results show that Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines show the highest accuracy , with prediction accuracy values of 86 % for some of the seminal parameters .
In conclusion artificial intelligence methods are a useful tool in order to predict the seminal profile of an individual from the environmental factors and life habits .
