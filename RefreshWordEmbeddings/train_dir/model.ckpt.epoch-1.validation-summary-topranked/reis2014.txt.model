In several domains , software applications have intensively used Knowledge Organization Systems ( KOS ) like database schemas , ontologies , taxonomies and thesauri and their associated semantic correspondences ( i.e. , mappings ) .
In this context , the maintenance of mappings affected by KOS evolution still remains an open research issue .
Although this problem appears relevant for many different computer science fields , ranging from database to artificial intelligence , literature has so far only superficially addressed it to enable more flexible , automatic and precise solutions .
Semantic correspondences , or mappings , connect entities of different Knowledge Organization Systems ( KOS ) ( Hodge , 2000 ) , like ontologies , database schemas and thesauri to improve the capabilities of software applications in sharing , integrating and managing wide variety of data .
