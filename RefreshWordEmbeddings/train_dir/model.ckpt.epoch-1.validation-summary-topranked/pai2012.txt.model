This paper reports the relative performance of an experimental comparison of some well-known classification techniques such as classical statistical , artificial intelligence , mathematical programming ( MP ) , and hybrid approaches .
The data had varying characteristics such as multicollinearity , nonlinearity , sample proportions , etc .
The results also indicate that the MP and hybrid approaches provide relatively higher and stable classification accuracy under all the data characteristics .
The manufacturer , based several demographic characteristics of an individual such as approximate annual income , age , education , zip code , etc. , has profiled the market into three segments â€“ very likely to buy ( VBuy ) , likely to buy ( LBuy ) , and unlikely to buy ( NBuy ) .
