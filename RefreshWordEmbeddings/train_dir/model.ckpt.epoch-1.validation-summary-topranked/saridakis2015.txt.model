At the same time , new car model design decisions may have a substantial effect on the cost and revenue drivers .
For example , although a new car model configuration with component commonality may lower manufacturing cost , it also hinders increased revenues that could have been achieved through product differentiation .
The proposed two-step methodology is also incorporated into a prototype system , which has been developed in an attempt to facilitate managerial decision making .
Our approach provides interesting insights into how new and existing car models can be combined in a product line and identifies the desired balance between differentiation and commonality levels among models within a product line , which elevates customer satisfaction .
