Image thresholding is a process for separating interesting objects within an image from their background .
An optimal threshold â€™ s selection can be regarded as a single objective optimization problem , where obtaining a solution can be computationally expensive and time-consuming , especially when the number of thresholds increases greatly .
The hybridization is done by adding a reset strategy , adopted from the Cuckoo Search , within the evolutionary loop of differential evolution .
In regard to global thresholding a single threshold value from the entire image histogram is selected , while local thresholding operates on smaller regions within the image and selects multiple thresholds , one for each region .
