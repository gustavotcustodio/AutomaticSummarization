In particular , adaptive filters are frequently applied to white noise reduction in audio .
Thus , the scope of this paper is to design and implement a novel approach of artificial hydrocarbon networks on adaptive filtering for audio signals .
Results demonstrate that AHNs can reduce noise from audio signals .
A comparison between the proposed algorithm and a FIR-filter is also provided .
