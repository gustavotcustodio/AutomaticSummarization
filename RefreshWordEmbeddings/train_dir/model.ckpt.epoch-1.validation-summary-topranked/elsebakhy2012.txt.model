Permeability prediction has been a challenge to reservoir engineers due to the lack of tools that measure it directly .
Unfortunately , due to both uncertainty and imprecision , the developed predictive modelings are less accurate compared to laboratory experimental core data .
The results show that the performance of functional networks ( separable and generalized associativity ) architecture with polynomial basis is accurate , reliable , and outperforms most of the existing predictive data mining modeling approaches .
Permeability is defined as the ability of porous rock to transmit fluid .
