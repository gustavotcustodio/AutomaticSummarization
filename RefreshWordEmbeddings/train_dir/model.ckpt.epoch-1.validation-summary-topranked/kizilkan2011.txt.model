This study presents thermodynamic performance modeling of an experimental refrigeration system driven by variable speed compressor using artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) with small data sets .
For this aim , an experimental refrigeration system was designed with a frequency inverter mounted on compressor electric motor .
The experiments were made for different compressor electric motor frequencies .
Instead of several experiments , the use of ANNs had been proposed to determine the system performance parameters based on various compressor frequencies and cooling loads using results of experimental analysis .
