Multilevel thresholding is an important technique for image processing and pattern recognition .
The maximum entropy thresholding ( MET ) has been widely applied in the literature .
In this paper , a new multilevel MET algorithm based on the technology of the artificial bee colony ( ABC ) algorithm is proposed : the maximum entropy based artificial bee colony thresholding ( MEABCT ) method .
Zahara , Fan , and Tsai ( 2005 ) presented a hybrid optimization scheme for multiple thresholding by the criteria of Otsu â€™ s minimum within-class variance and Gaussian function fitting .
