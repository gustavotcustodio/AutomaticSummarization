We developed various artificial stock markets populated with different numbers of traders using a special adaptive form of the Strongly Typed Genetic Programming ( STGP ) -based learning algorithm .
We then applied the STGP technique to historical data from three indices – the FTSE 100 , S & P 500 , and Russell 3000 – to investigate the formation of stock market dynamics and market efficiency .
We have also found that stock market dynamics and nonlinearity are better explained by the evolutionary process associated with the Adaptive Market Hypothesis ( AMH ) , because different trader populations behave as an efficient adaptive system evolving over time .
Samuelson ( 1965 ) generated a series of non-linear programming solutions to spatial pricing models with no uncertainty , and proposed that in informationally efficient markets price changes are unpredictable if market prices fully incorporate the information disseminated from all market participants .
