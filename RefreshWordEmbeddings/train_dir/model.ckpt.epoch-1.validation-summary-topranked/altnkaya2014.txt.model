Rail rolling process is one of the most complicated hot rolling processes .
Evaluating the effects of parametric values on this complex process is only possible through modeling .
BD1 , BD2 , and Tandem are three main parts of the rolling mill , and in order to obtain the force values of the 49 kg/m rail in each pass for the BD1 and BD2 sections , the force and torque values for the Tandem section , parameter values of 60 , 54 , 46 , and 33 kg/m type rails were used .
Comparing the results obtained from the ANN model and the actual field data demonstrated that force and torque values were obtained with acceptable error rates .
