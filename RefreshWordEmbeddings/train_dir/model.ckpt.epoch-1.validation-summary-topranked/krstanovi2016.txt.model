Thus , finding the distance between two GMMs in the original space is reduced to finding the distance between sets of lower dimensional Euclidian vectors , pondered by corresponding weights .
By doing so , we manage to obtain much better trade-off between the recognition accuracy and the computational complexity , in comparison to the measures between GMMs utilizing distances between Gaussian components evaluated in the original parameter space .
Thus , the GMM measure that we propose is suitable for applications in AI systems that use GMMs in their recognition tasks and operate on large data sets , as the required number of overall Gaussian components involved in such systems is always large .
We evaluate the proposed GMM measure on artificial , as well as real-world experimental data obtaining a much better trade-off between recognition accuracy and the computational complexity , in comparison to all baseline GMM similarity measures tested .
