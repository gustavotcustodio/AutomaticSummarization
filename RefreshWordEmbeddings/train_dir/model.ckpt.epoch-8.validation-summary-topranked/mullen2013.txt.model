This paper extends on previous work in applying an ant algorithm to image feature extraction , focusing on edge pattern extraction , as well as the broader study of self-organisation mechanisms in digital image environments .
A novel method of distributed adaptive thresholding is introduced to the ant algorithm , which enables automated distributed adaptive thresholding across the swarm .
This paper reports research into the application of swarm intelligence to image feature extraction , and specifically , the use of an ant-algorithm approach based on the original Ant System ( AS ) ( Dorigo & Gambardella , 1997 ) .
Analysis of the algorithm is carried out on two levels : with respect to the use of ant-algorithms for facilitating emergent self-organisation and pattern formation at the swarm level , in response to local agent–agent and agent–environment interactions , by imposing simple decision making rules on simple artificial agents ; and with respect to the application of image feature extraction .
