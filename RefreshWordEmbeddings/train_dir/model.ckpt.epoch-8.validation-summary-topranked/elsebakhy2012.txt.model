Permeability prediction has been a challenge to reservoir engineers due to the lack of tools that measure it directly .
Recently , researchers utilized statistical regression , neural networks , and fuzzy logic to estimate both permeability and porosity from well logs .
Future work can be achieved using different structure of functional networks with different basis , interaction terms , ensemble and hybrid strategies , different clustering , and outlier identification techniques within different oil and gas challenge problems , namely , 3D passive seismic , identification of lithofacies types , history matching , rock mechanics , viscosity , risk assessment , and reservoir characterization .
Advances have pushed the envelope of what is feasible , both in terms of finding the oil and figuring out how to extract it once an oil and gas company has identified a location .
