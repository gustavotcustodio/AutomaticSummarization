In several domains , software applications have intensively used Knowledge Organization Systems ( KOS ) like database schemas , ontologies , taxonomies and thesauri and their associated semantic correspondences ( i.e. , mappings ) .
This underlines the relevance and capabilities of KOS and mappings to manage and integrate vast amounts of data .
However , the dynamic nature of domain knowledge forces knowledge engineers to constantly modify KOS , to keep them up to date and useful .
Although this problem appears relevant for many different computer science fields , ranging from database to artificial intelligence , literature has so far only superficially addressed it to enable more flexible , automatic and precise solutions .
