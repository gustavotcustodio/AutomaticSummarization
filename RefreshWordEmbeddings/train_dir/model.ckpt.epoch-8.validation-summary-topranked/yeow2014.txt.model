Case-based reasoning ( CBR ) is one of the matured paradigms of artificial intelligence for problem solving .
CBR has been applied in many areas in the commercial sector to assist daily operations .
The design and development of an Intelligent Forensic Autopsy Report System ( I-AuReSys ) basing on a CBR method along with the experimental results are presented .
However , many systems , which store data , require some degree of intelligence to reduce turnaround time of an investigation process and mitigate errors such as those arising from human negligence or mistakes .
