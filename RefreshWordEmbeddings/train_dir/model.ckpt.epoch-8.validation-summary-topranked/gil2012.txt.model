Fertility rates have dramatically decreased in the last two decades , especially in men .
It has been described that environmental factors , as well as life habits , may affect semen quality .
The results show that Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines show the highest accuracy , with prediction accuracy values of 86 % for some of the seminal parameters .
Numerous studies show a decrease in semen parameters during the past two decades ( Auger , Kunstmann , Czyglik , & Jouannet , 1995 ; Splingart et al. , 2011 ; Swan , Elkin , & Fenster , 1997 , 2000 ) , affecting the male fertility potential .
