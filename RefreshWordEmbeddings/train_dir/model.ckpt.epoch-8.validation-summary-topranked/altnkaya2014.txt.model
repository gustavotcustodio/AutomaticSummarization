Rail rolling process is one of the most complicated hot rolling processes .
In this study , the production parameters of different types of rails in the rail rolling processes were modeled with an artificial neural network ( ANN ) , and it was aimed to obtain optimum parameter values for a different type of rail .
For this purpose , the data from the Rail and Profile Rolling Mill in Kardemir Iron & Steel Works Co. ( Karab√ºk , Turkey ) were used .
Comparing the results obtained from the ANN model and the actual field data demonstrated that force and torque values were obtained with acceptable error rates .
