Permeability prediction has been a challenge to reservoir engineers due to the lack of tools that measure it directly .
The most reliable data of permeability obtained from laboratory measurements on cores do not provide a continuous profile along the depth of the formation .
Unfortunately , due to both uncertainty and imprecision , the developed predictive modelings are less accurate compared to laboratory experimental core data .
The new intelligence paradigm helps to overcome the most common limitations of the existing modeling techniques in statistics , data mining , machine learning , and artificial intelligence communities .
