This paper reports the relative performance of an experimental comparison of some well-known classification techniques such as classical statistical , artificial intelligence , mathematical programming ( MP ) , and hybrid approaches .
In particular , we examine the four-group , three-variable problem and the associated error rates for the four groups when each of the models is applied to various sets of simulated data .
The data had varying characteristics such as multicollinearity , nonlinearity , sample proportions , etc .
We concentrate on individual error rates for the four groups , i.e. , we count the number of group 1 values classified into group 2 , group 3 , and group 4 and vice versa .
