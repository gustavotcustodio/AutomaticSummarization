Lung cancer is a public health priority worldwide due to the high mortality rate and the costs involved .
Early detection of lung cancer is important for increasing the survival rate , however , frequently its diagnosis is not made opportunely , since detection methods are not sufficiently sensitive and specific .
However , when used alone they show low sensitivity and specificity because lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease .
This panel was able to correctly classify 135 out of 150 subjects , showing a correct classification rate for lung cancer patients of 88.9 % , 93.3 % and 90 % in training , validation and testing phases , respectively .
