The need for a comparison between two Gaussian Mixture Models ( GMMs ) plays a crucial role in various pattern recognition tasks and is involved as a key components in many expert and artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems dealing with real-life problems .
As those system often operate on large data-sets and use high dimensional features , it is crucial for their recognition component to be computationally efficient in addition to its good recognition accuracy .
By doing so , we manage to obtain much better trade-off between the recognition accuracy and the computational complexity , in comparison to the measures between GMMs utilizing distances between Gaussian components evaluated in the original parameter space .
Thus , the GMM measure that we propose is suitable for applications in AI systems that use GMMs in their recognition tasks and operate on large data sets , as the required number of overall Gaussian components involved in such systems is always large .
