Permeability prediction has been a challenge to reservoir engineers due to the lack of tools that measure it directly .
The most reliable data of permeability obtained from laboratory measurements on cores do not provide a continuous profile along the depth of the formation .
Recently , researchers utilized statistical regression , neural networks , and fuzzy logic to estimate both permeability and porosity from well logs .
Comparative studies were carried out using real-life industry wireline logs to compare the performance of the new framework with the most popular modeling schemes , such as linear/nonlinear regression , neural networks , and fuzzy logic inference systems .
