The emergence of Omni-channel has affected the practical design of the supply chain network ( SCN ) with the purpose of providing better products and services for customers .
In contrast to the conventional SCN , a new strategic model for designing SCN with multiple distribution channels ( MDCSCN ) is introduced in this research .
Sustainable objectives , i.e. , reducing economic cost , enlarging customer coverage and weakening environmental influences , are involved in designing the MDCSN .
A well designed SCN could be treated as a flexible and scalable system platform , which supports further operations and activities .
