Background Epidemiological statistics has shown that there are approximately 1.2 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed every year and the death rate of these patients is 17.8 % .
To improve the efficiency of diagnosis , several distinct tumor marker groups are combined together using a mathematical evaluation model , called artificial neural network ( ANN ) .
Lung cancer markers have been identified to include carcinoembryonic antigen , carcinoma antigen 125 , neuron specific enolase , Î²2-microglobulin , gastrin , soluble interleukin-6 receptor , sialic acid , pseudouridine , nitric oxide , and some metal ions .
The optimal marker group-coupled ANN model was employed as an intelligent diagnosis system .
