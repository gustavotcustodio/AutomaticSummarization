Case-based reasoning ( CBR ) is one of the matured paradigms of artificial intelligence for problem solving .
CBR has been applied in many areas in the commercial sector to assist daily operations .
Our system is able to extract features by using an information extraction ( IE ) technique from the existing autopsy reports ; then the system analyzes the case similarities by coupling the CBR technique with a Na√Øve Bayes learner for feature-weights learning ; and finally it produces an outcome recommendation .
However , many systems , which store data , require some degree of intelligence to reduce turnaround time of an investigation process and mitigate errors such as those arising from human negligence or mistakes .
