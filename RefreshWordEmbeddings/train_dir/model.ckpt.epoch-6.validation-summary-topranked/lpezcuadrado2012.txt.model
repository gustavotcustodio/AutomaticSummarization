Knowledge is one the most valuable assets in todays companies .
Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) techniques aim to represent the knowledge in a way that can be applied to solving complex problems or supporting decision making processes .
In this scenario , knowledge workers perform their duties in knowledge-intensive organizations ( Soto-Acosta , Casado-Lumbreras , & Cabezas-Isla , 2010 ) , with a high interest in keeping the actual knowledge and expanding it via innovation ( O â€™ Sullivan & Dooley , 2010 ) .
While personalization focuses on people and provides possibilities to share their knowledge ( person to person ) , the codification strategy focuses on documents and provides possibilities to write down and store information and for others to access it ( people to documents to people ) .
