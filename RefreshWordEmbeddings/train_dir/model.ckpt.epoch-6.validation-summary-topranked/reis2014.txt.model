In several domains , software applications have intensively used Knowledge Organization Systems ( KOS ) like database schemas , ontologies , taxonomies and thesauri and their associated semantic correspondences ( i.e. , mappings ) .
Although this problem appears relevant for many different computer science fields , ranging from database to artificial intelligence , literature has so far only superficially addressed it to enable more flexible , automatic and precise solutions .
This article presents , discusses and compares existing approaches for maintaining mappings and describes open research challenges .
Taking biomedical KOS as an example , mappings between two distinct KOS , named Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms1 ( SNOMED CT® ) ( SCT for short ) , and International Classification of Disease – Clinical Modification2 ( ICD-9-CM ) ( ICD for short ) , can easily support users accessing external data annotated with ICD from clinical records annotated with SCT .
