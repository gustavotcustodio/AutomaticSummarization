Multilevel thresholding is an important technique for image processing and pattern recognition .
In this paper , a new multilevel MET algorithm based on the technology of the artificial bee colony ( ABC ) algorithm is proposed : the maximum entropy based artificial bee colony thresholding ( MEABCT ) method .
Four different methods are compared to this proposed method : the particle swarm optimization ( PSO ) , the hybrid cooperative-comprehensive learning based PSO algorithm ( HCOCLPSO ) , the Fast Otsu â€™ s method and the honey bee mating optimization ( HBMO ) .
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MEABCT algorithm can search for multiple thresholds which are very close to the optimal ones examined by the exhaustive search method .
