Fertility rates have dramatically decreased in the last two decades , especially in men .
To do that we collect data by a normalized questionnaire from young healthy volunteers and then , we use the results of a semen analysis to asses the accuracy in the prediction of the three classification methods mentioned above .
There are good classifiers in the AI such as artificial neural network ( ANN ) , DT ( Polat & Gnes , 2009b ) , SVM ( Conforti & Guido , 2010 ) or even hybrid methods that combine ANNs and fuzzy logic into fuzzy neural networks ( FNN ) ( Kahramanli & Allahverd , 2008 ) which are widely used to aid medical diagnosis by means of decision support systems construction .
These methods include advantages as ( a ) Ease of optimisation , resulting in cost-effective and flexible non-linear modelling of large data sets ; ( b ) Accuracy for predictive inference , with potential to support clinical decision making ; ( c ) These models can make knowledge dissemination easier by providing explanation , for instance , using rule extraction or sensitivity analysis ( Lisboa & Taktak , 2006 ) .
