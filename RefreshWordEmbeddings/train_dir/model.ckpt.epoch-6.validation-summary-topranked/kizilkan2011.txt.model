This study presents thermodynamic performance modeling of an experimental refrigeration system driven by variable speed compressor using artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) with small data sets .
Controlling the rotational speed of compressor with a frequency inverter is one of the best methods to vary the capacity of refrigeration system .
Instead of several experiments , the use of ANNs had been proposed to determine the system performance parameters based on various compressor frequencies and cooling loads using results of experimental analysis .
The primary objective of this study is to develop a new approach based on artificial neural networks to determine the performance of variable speed experimental refrigeration system in terms of thermodynamics and energy consumption aspects .
