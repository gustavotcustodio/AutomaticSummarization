This paper analyzes recent literature in the search for trends in business intelligence applications for the banking industry .
To analyze such a large number of manuscripts , text mining techniques were used in pursuit for relevant terms on both business intelligence and banking domains .
To confirm such hypotheses , relevant articles were collected and scrutinized , allowing to validate the text mining procedure .
The results show that credit in banking is clearly the main application trend , particularly predicting risk and thus supporting credit approval or denial .
