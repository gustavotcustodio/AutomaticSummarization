Many audio signal applications are corrupted by noise .
Recent work provides that there exist some insights on using an artificial intelligence method called artificial hydrocarbon networks ( AHNs ) for filtering audio signals .
Thus , the scope of this paper is to design and implement a novel approach of artificial hydrocarbon networks on adaptive filtering for audio signals .
In order to face it , different audio filters have been developed in audio signals ( Parks & Burrus , 1987 ; Smith , 1997 ; Winder , 2002 ) .
