The product life cycle of cars is becoming shorter and carmakers constantly introduce new or revised models in their lines , tailored to their customer needs .
This paper develops and illustrates a state of the art , nature-inspired approach , to design car lines that optimize the degree of differentiation vs commonality among models in the line .
More specifically , we apply a swarm intelligence mechanism to stated preference data derived from a large-scale conjoint experiment that measures consumer preferences for passenger cars in a sample of 1164 individuals .
Our approach provides interesting insights into how new and existing car models can be combined in a product line and identifies the desired balance between differentiation and commonality levels among models within a product line , which elevates customer satisfaction .
