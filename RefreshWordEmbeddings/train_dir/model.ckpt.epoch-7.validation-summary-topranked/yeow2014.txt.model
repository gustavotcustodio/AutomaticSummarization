Case-based reasoning ( CBR ) is one of the matured paradigms of artificial intelligence for problem solving .
CBR has been applied in many areas in the commercial sector to assist daily operations .
Even though forensic personnel have consciously used past experiences in solving new cases , the idea of applying machine intelligence to support decision-making in forensics is still in its infancy and poses a great challenge .
Our system is able to extract features by using an information extraction ( IE ) technique from the existing autopsy reports ; then the system analyzes the case similarities by coupling the CBR technique with a Na√Øve Bayes learner for feature-weights learning ; and finally it produces an outcome recommendation .
