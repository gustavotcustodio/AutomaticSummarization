This paper reports the relative performance of an experimental comparison of some well-known classification techniques such as classical statistical , artificial intelligence , mathematical programming ( MP ) , and hybrid approaches .
In particular , we examine the four-group , three-variable problem and the associated error rates for the four groups when each of the models is applied to various sets of simulated data .
The data had varying characteristics such as multicollinearity , nonlinearity , sample proportions , etc .
The results indicate that in general not only are MP , k-NN , and hybrid approaches relatively better at overall classification but they also provide a much better balance between error rates for the top customer groups .
