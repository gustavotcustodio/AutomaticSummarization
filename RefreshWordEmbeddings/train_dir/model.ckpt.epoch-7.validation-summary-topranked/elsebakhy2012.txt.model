Permeability prediction has been a challenge to reservoir engineers due to the lack of tools that measure it directly .
The most reliable data of permeability obtained from laboratory measurements on cores do not provide a continuous profile along the depth of the formation .
Recently , researchers utilized statistical regression , neural networks , and fuzzy logic to estimate both permeability and porosity from well logs .
The following is a brief description of each one of these utilized feature selection procedures : â€¢ Forward selection : It starts with an empty model .
