Lung cancer is a public health priority worldwide due to the high mortality rate and the costs involved .
Early detection of lung cancer is important for increasing the survival rate , however , frequently its diagnosis is not made opportunely , since detection methods are not sufficiently sensitive and specific .
In recent years serum biomarkers have been proposed as a method that might enhance diagnostic capabilities and complement imaging studies .
However , it has become clear that a universal biomarker panel does not exist , and optimized panels need to be developed and validated in each population before their application in a clinical setting .
