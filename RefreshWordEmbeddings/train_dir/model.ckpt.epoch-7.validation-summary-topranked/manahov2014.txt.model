We developed various artificial stock markets populated with different numbers of traders using a special adaptive form of the Strongly Typed Genetic Programming ( STGP ) -based learning algorithm .
We then applied the STGP technique to historical data from three indices – the FTSE 100 , S & P 500 , and Russell 3000 – to investigate the formation of stock market dynamics and market efficiency .
We used several econometric techniques to investigate the emergent properties of the stock markets .
We have found that the introduction of increased heterogeneity and greater genetic diversity leads to higher market efficiency in terms of the Efficient Market Hypothesis ( EMH ) , demonstrating that market efficiency does not necessarily correlate with rationality assumptions .
