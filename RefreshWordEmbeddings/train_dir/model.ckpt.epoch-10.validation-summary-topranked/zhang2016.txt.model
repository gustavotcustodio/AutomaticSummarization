The emergence of Omni-channel has affected the practical design of the supply chain network ( SCN ) with the purpose of providing better products and services for customers .
In contrast to the conventional SCN , a new strategic model for designing SCN with multiple distribution channels ( MDCSCN ) is introduced in this research .
The MDCSCN model benefits customers by providing direct products and services from available facilities instead of the conventional flow of products and services .
A modified multi-objective artificial bee colony ( MOABC ) algorithm is introduced to solve the MDCSCN model , which integrates the priority-based encoding mechanism , the Pareto optimality and the swarm intelligence of the bee colony .
