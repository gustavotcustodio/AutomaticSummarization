Permeability prediction has been a challenge to reservoir engineers due to the lack of tools that measure it directly .
Recently , researchers utilized statistical regression , neural networks , and fuzzy logic to estimate both permeability and porosity from well logs .
The new intelligence paradigm helps to overcome the most common limitations of the existing modeling techniques in statistics , data mining , machine learning , and artificial intelligence communities .
Comparative studies were carried out using real-life industry wireline logs to compare the performance of the new framework with the most popular modeling schemes , such as linear/nonlinear regression , neural networks , and fuzzy logic inference systems .
