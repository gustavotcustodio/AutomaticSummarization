Background Epidemiological statistics has shown that there are approximately 1.2 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed every year and the death rate of these patients is 17.8 % .
To improve the efficiency of diagnosis , several distinct tumor marker groups are combined together using a mathematical evaluation model , called artificial neural network ( ANN ) .
Results We have presented evidence that this system is superior to a traditional statistical method , its diagnosis specificity significantly improved from 72.0 % to 100.0 % and its accuracy increased from 71.4 % to 92.8 % .
Epidemiology has revealed that there are approximately 1.2 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed every year and the death rate of these malignant patients is 17.8 % ( Strauss , Dominioni , & Jett , 2005 ) .
