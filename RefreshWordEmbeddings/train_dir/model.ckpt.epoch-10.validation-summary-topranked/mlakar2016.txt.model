Image thresholding is a process for separating interesting objects within an image from their background .
An optimal threshold â€™ s selection can be regarded as a single objective optimization problem , where obtaining a solution can be computationally expensive and time-consuming , especially when the number of thresholds increases greatly .
Additionally a study of different evolutionary or swarm-based intelligence algorithms for the purpose of thresholding , with a higher number of thresholds was performed , since many real-world applications require more than just a few thresholds for further processing .
The efficiency of the hybrid was compared to the cuckoo search and self-adaptive differential evolution , the original differential evolution , particle swarm optimization , and artificial bee colony where the results showed the superiority of the hybrid in terms of better segmentation results with the increased number of thresholds .
