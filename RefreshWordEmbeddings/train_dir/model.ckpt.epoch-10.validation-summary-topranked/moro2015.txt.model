This paper analyzes recent literature in the search for trends in business intelligence applications for the banking industry .
To analyze such a large number of manuscripts , text mining techniques were used in pursuit for relevant terms on both business intelligence and banking domains .
Such procedure allowed for the identification of relationships between terms and topics grouping articles , enabling to emerge hypotheses regarding research directions .
The results show that credit in banking is clearly the main application trend , particularly predicting risk and thus supporting credit approval or denial .
