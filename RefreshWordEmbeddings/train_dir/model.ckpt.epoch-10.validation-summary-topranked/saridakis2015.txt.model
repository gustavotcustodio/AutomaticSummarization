The product life cycle of cars is becoming shorter and carmakers constantly introduce new or revised models in their lines , tailored to their customer needs .
For example , although a new car model configuration with component commonality may lower manufacturing cost , it also hinders increased revenues that could have been achieved through product differentiation .
Industry practice and research to date suggest that product line design decisions in the car industry range between two options , namely , differentiation and commonality .
For example , General Motors was negatively criticized for its look-alike car line-up and Honda lost significant market share for its Acura model which was considered to be nothing more than a Honda Accord .
