Many audio signal applications are corrupted by noise .
Recent work provides that there exist some insights on using an artificial intelligence method called artificial hydrocarbon networks ( AHNs ) for filtering audio signals .
Thus , the scope of this paper is to design and implement a novel approach of artificial hydrocarbon networks on adaptive filtering for audio signals .
At last , the proposed training method for finding the parameters involved in the AHN-filter can also be used in other fields of application .
