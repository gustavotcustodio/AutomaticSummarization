To do that we collect data by a normalized questionnaire from young healthy volunteers and then , we use the results of a semen analysis to asses the accuracy in the prediction of the three classification methods mentioned above .
The results show that Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines show the highest accuracy , with prediction accuracy values of 86 % for some of the seminal parameters .
Numerous studies show a decrease in semen parameters during the past two decades ( Auger , Kunstmann , Czyglik , & Jouannet , 1995 ; Splingart et al. , 2011 ; Swan , Elkin , & Fenster , 1997 , 2000 ) , affecting the male fertility potential .
There are good classifiers in the AI such as artificial neural network ( ANN ) , DT ( Polat & Gnes , 2009b ) , SVM ( Conforti & Guido , 2010 ) or even hybrid methods that combine ANNs and fuzzy logic into fuzzy neural networks ( FNN ) ( Kahramanli & Allahverd , 2008 ) which are widely used to aid medical diagnosis by means of decision support systems construction .
