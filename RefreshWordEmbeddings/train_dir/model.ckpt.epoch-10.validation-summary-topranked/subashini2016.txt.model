Brain tumor grade identification is an invasive technique and clinicians rely on biopsy and spinal tap method .
The proposed method takes an effort to develop a non-invasive method for the tumor grade ( Low/High ) identification using magnetic resonant images .
An analysis on the performance of the segmentation techniques , feature extraction methods , automatic feature selection ( SFLA ) and constructed classifiers ( support vector machines , learning vector quantization and Naives Bayes ) is done on the basis of accuracy , efficiency and elapsed time .
Fuzzy c-means segmentation outperformed other segmentation techniques , shape and size based textural feature promoted the demarcation of tumor grades , Naive Bayes classifier succeeded in terms of efficiency , error and elapse time when compared with SVM and LVQ .
