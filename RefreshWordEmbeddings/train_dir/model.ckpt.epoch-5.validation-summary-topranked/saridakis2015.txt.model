The product life cycle of cars is becoming shorter and carmakers constantly introduce new or revised models in their lines , tailored to their customer needs .
At the same time , new car model design decisions may have a substantial effect on the cost and revenue drivers .
For example , although a new car model configuration with component commonality may lower manufacturing cost , it also hinders increased revenues that could have been achieved through product differentiation .
This paper develops and illustrates a state of the art , nature-inspired approach , to design car lines that optimize the degree of differentiation vs commonality among models in the line .
