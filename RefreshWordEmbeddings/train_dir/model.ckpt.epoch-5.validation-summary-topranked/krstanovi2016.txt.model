The need for a comparison between two Gaussian Mixture Models ( GMMs ) plays a crucial role in various pattern recognition tasks and is involved as a key components in many expert and artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems dealing with real-life problems .
As those system often operate on large data-sets and use high dimensional features , it is crucial for their recognition component to be computationally efficient in addition to its good recognition accuracy .
In this work we deliver the novel similarity measure between GMMs , by LPP-like projecting the components of a particular GMM , from the high dimensional original parameter space , to a much lower dimensional space .
Thus , finding the distance between two GMMs in the original space is reduced to finding the distance between sets of lower dimensional Euclidian vectors , pondered by corresponding weights .
