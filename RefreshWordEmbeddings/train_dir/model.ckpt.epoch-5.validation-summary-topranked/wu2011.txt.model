Background Epidemiological statistics has shown that there are approximately 1.2 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed every year and the death rate of these patients is 17.8 % .
Some tumor markers have been found to be valuable for earlier diagnosis , but a single marker has limitation in its sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnosis .
To improve the efficiency of diagnosis , several distinct tumor marker groups are combined together using a mathematical evaluation model , called artificial neural network ( ANN ) .
The optimal marker group-coupled ANN model was employed as an intelligent diagnosis system .
