Case-based reasoning ( CBR ) is one of the matured paradigms of artificial intelligence for problem solving .
CBR has been applied in many areas in the commercial sector to assist daily operations .
Even though forensic personnel have consciously used past experiences in solving new cases , the idea of applying machine intelligence to support decision-making in forensics is still in its infancy and poses a great challenge .
The design and development of an Intelligent Forensic Autopsy Report System ( I-AuReSys ) basing on a CBR method along with the experimental results are presented .
