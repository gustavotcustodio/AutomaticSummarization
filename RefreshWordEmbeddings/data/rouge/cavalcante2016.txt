We propose a survey of soft computing techniques applied to financial market. We surveyed several primary studies proposed in the literature. A framework for building an intelligent trading system was proposed. Future directions of this research field are discussed.

0.081400 - Financial markets play an important role on the economical and social organization of modern society.
0.084388 - In these kinds of markets, information is an invaluable asset.
0.058700 - However, with the modernization of the financial transactions and the information systems, the large amount of information available for a trader can make prohibitive the analysis of a financial asset.
0.086917 - In the last decades, many researchers have attempted to develop computational intelligent methods and algorithms to support the decision-making in different financial market segments.
0.144143 - In the literature, there is a huge number of scientific papers that investigate the use of computational intelligence techniques to solve financial market problems.
0.103976 - However, only few studies have focused on review the literature of this topic.
0.060449 - Most of the existing review articles have a limited scope, either by focusing on a specific financial market application or by focusing on a family of machine learning algorithms.
0.124611 - This paper presents a review of the application of several computational intelligent methods in several financial applications.
0.076941 - This paper gives an overview of the most important primary studies published from 2009 to 2015, which cover techniques for preprocessing and clustering of financial data, for forecasting future market movements, for mining financial text information, among others.
0.108401 - The main contributions of this paper are: (i) a comprehensive review of the literature of this field, (ii) the definition of a systematic procedure for guiding the task of building an intelligent trading system and (iii) a discussion about the main challenges and open problems in this scientific field.
0.091873 - Financial markets are very important for the economical and social organization of modern society.
0.064509 - Financial activities play an important role in the world economy, since they influence the economic development of several countries worldwide (Lin, Chiu, & Lin, 2012).
0.049524 - In these kinds of markets, the success of an investor depends on the quality of the information he uses to support the decision-making, and on how fast he is able to take decisions.
0.069952 - Due to its practical importance, the analysis of financial market movements has been widely studied in the fields of finance, engineering and mathematics in the last decades (Yoo, Kim, & Jan, 2005).
0.117710 - Recently, some statistical and soft computing mechanisms have been proposed to provide support to the decisions of investors in different financial market segments.
0.059998 - Two approaches commonly used to analyze and predict financial market behaviors are (i) the fundamental analysis and (ii) the technical analysis.
0.050891 - The former approach studies the economic factors that may influence market movements, and it is best suited for a longer term prediction spectrum.
0.012012 - The technicians, on the other hand, believe that the price already includes all the fundamentals that affect it.
0.068027 - In this sense, technicians usually model the historical behavior of a financial asset as a time series, believing that the history tends to repeat itself (Murphy, 1999).
0.056225 - This modeling approach avoids the analysis of those subjective economic factors.
0.061400 - Financial time series prediction can be considered one of the main challenges in the time series and machine learning literature (Tay & Cao, 2001).
0.079323 - In the last decades, several approaches have been proposed to predict financial time series and to provide decision-making support systems (Teixeira & Oliveira, 2010).
0.057554 - Two major classes of work which attempt to forecast financial time series are the statistical models and machine learning approaches (Wang, Wang, Zhang, & Guo, 2011).
0.057971 - Traditional statistical methods generally assume that the time series under study are generated from a linear process (Kumar & Murugan, 2013), and try to model the underlying time series generation process in order to make predictions about the future values of the series.
0.034783 - However, financial time series are essentially complex, highly noisy, dynamic, nonlinear, nonparametric, and chaotic in nature (Si & Yin, 2013).
0.048048 - Machine learning techniques have been applied with relative success in modeling and predicting financial time series (Lee, 2009).
0.039506 - Many machine learning techniques are able to capture nonlinear relationship between relevant factors with no prior knowledge about the input data (Atsalakis & Valavanis, 2009).
0.036530 - Among these techniques, artificial neural networks (ANN) have been widely used in forecasting time series, since they are data-driven, self-adaptive methods able to capture nonlinear behaviors of time series without any statistical assumptions about the data (Lu, Lee, & Chiu, 2009; Tay & Cao, 2001).
0.057743 - Due to these advantages, several types of ANNs and hybrid mechanisms have been used in forecasting financial time series (Atsalakis & Valavanis, 2009).
0.057847 - In the last years, some researches, motivated by the fundamental analysis, have investigated how to predict future market movements by mining informations in textual format.
0.055814 - In this branch of research, financial news (Groth & Muntermann, 2011; Schumaker, Zhang, Huang, & Chen, 2012), financial reports (Wang, Huang, & Wang, 2012), and even information in micro-blogs (Ruiz, Hristidis, Castillo, Gionis, & Jaimes, 2012) are considered relevant source of informations for predicting future market behavior.
0.059218 - These approaches investigated how mining important features on textual data or how to identify author sentiments in the news to improve the forecasting of future financial values.
0.112852 - The main purpose of this article is to review the recent computational intelligence approaches designed to solve financial market problems.
0.114719 - Despite the high number of scientific papers which propose intelligent and expert systems, techniques and algorithms applied to financial markets, just a few review articles have been published in relevant journals and conferences in the last years.
0.073844 - Most of the existing review articles have focused on a specific financial market application or on a family of machine learning algorithms.
0.147687 - In this article, we make a comprehensive survey of machine learning methods applied to the financial context published from 2009 to nowadays.
0.065544 - The scope of this review includes articles dealing with preprocessing and clustering of financial data, forecasting of future market movements, mining of financial information, among others.

0.081998 - In the literature, there are not many review articles that cover this topic.
0.117710 - Most of the published surveys found in the literature are specialized in some computational intelligence technique, such as ANNs or genetic algorithms (GA).
0.088134 - Vanstone and Finnie (2009) proposed an empirical method for developing automatic trading systems using ANN.
0.087823 - In that study, the authors reviewed some work that use fundamental and technical analysis to construct intelligent trading systems.
0.052713 - They also described some key steps in using ANN for this purpose, namely the selection of inputs and outputs, the determination of the neural architecture and how to process the output signals produced by an ANN to create rules to enter and exit trades.
0.110577 - Li and Ma (2010) surveyed the application of neural networks in several subareas of financial markets.

0.088272 - That paper provides a brief history of ANNs and basic concepts of stock market before enumerating some primary studies that use this approach to solve the stock market forecasting problem.
0.073620 - Despite the fact that these reviews have an intersection with the period of our research, they have a limited scope, since they focus in just one family of computational intelligence algorithms.
0.109575 - Most of the machine learning approaches proposed in the literature to solve the financial forecasting problem rely on quantitative data arising from technical analysis.
0.074385 - But some primary studies have investigated the use of techniques that rely on qualitative data arising from financial news, company financial reports, among others.
0.068337 - Nikfarjam, Emadzadeh, and Muthaiyah (2010) surveyed some primary studies which implement text mining techniques to extract qualitative information about companies and use these informations to predict the future behavior of stock prices based on how good or bad are the news about that companies.
0.074100 - In that work, authors provide a comparison of the main text mining-based methods proposed in the literature considering some characteristics of the primary studies, namely (i) the feature selection technique, (ii) the feature representation approach, (iii) the news source used, (iv) the classifier applied, (v) the number of categories or goal classes and (vi) the directional accuracy.
0.127423 - Our review also covers primary studies which proposed text mining approaches for assisting in financial market analysis, however we provide an updated discussion of this topic in comparison to that review.
0.101602 - An important work related to the present research was proposed by Atsalakis and Valavanis (2009).
0.097354 - In that paper, the authors have surveyed over 100 scientific articles that apply soft computing techniques to solve the stock market forecasting problem.
0.052052 - The examined primary studies were classified over five different perspectives: (i) the stock market investigated, (ii) the input variables used, (iii) the methods and parameters used to build the predictors, (iv) the benchmarks used in each study, and (v) the performance measures used to evaluate the proposed methods.
0.094841 - Despite the valuable contribution of that paper in organizing this literature field, it is concentrated in machine learning methods applied to forecasting.
0.120490 - In contrast, our survey presents different perspectives of the literature, since it investigates several areas related to computational intelligence and financial markets, not only forecasting.
0.027100 - Besides, the review made by Atsalakis and Valavanis (2009) is relatively old, and several advances were made from 2009 to nowadays.
0.079887 - A very recent survey (Tkáč & Verner, 2016) reviewed primary studies which have used ANNs in business applications, such as auditing and accounting, crediting scoring, financial analysis, inflation, marketing, among others.
0.100295 - Our scope is more restricted in terms of the financial applications investigated, since we focus on expert and intelligent systems designed to financial market analysis and prediction.
0.064257 - However our scope is wider in terms of the algorithms covered.
0.050314 - Aguilar-Rivera, Valenzuela-Rendón, and Rodríguez-Ortiz (2015) review the application of evolutionary computation methods, such as genetic algorithms, genetic programming and evolutionary algorithms, to solve financial problems.
0.044818 - This review is also very recent, however it has a more restricted scope, since it discuss just evolutionary-inspired methods.
0.042328 - Our review has a broader scope.
0.115942 - In this section, we discuss some key concepts that will provide a foundation for the remainder of the paper.
0.057743 - Technical and fundamental analysis Market analysis comprises the study of several market attributes and features that influence on prices of financial assets.
0.073233 - The main goal of market analysis is to understand market behaviors in order to help in the decision-making process.
0.071742 - Two main widely used approaches for analyzing financial markets are the fundamental and the technical analysis.
0.078215 - Both approaches have the primary goal of understanding the price movements and predict their future directions.
0.041995 - However, the major difference between these two strategies is related with the nature of market features considered by each approach (Murphy, 1999).
0.046639 - Fundamental analysis started in 1928 with an important investor, Benjamin Graham, which stated that investors need to study some fundamental attributes of a company before investing, such as the size of firm, capitalization and price-earnings ratio (Vanstone & Finnie, 2009), revenue, expenses, assets, liabilities and other financial aspects of a company.
0.069930 - Fundamental analysts believe that the stock price of a company is reflected by several political and economical factors which are internal and external to the company.
0.075472 - Several quantitative tools and indicators were developed to assist in studying the fundamentals of a company, such as management policy, marketing strategy, product innovation, financial ratios, among others (Lam, 2004).
0.063872 - In order to improve the analysis, some other factors such as market trends, legislation, and even financial news, web and social networks have been used to study the fundamentals of a company.
0.072823 - Technical analysis, on the other hand, does not take explicitly into consideration the internal and external characteristics of a company in the study of market price movements.
0.052607 - Technicians believe that all the fundamentals that influence the market movements are immediately incorporated in the price (Murphy, 1999).
0.061625 - Based on this strategy, technicians abstract the fundamentals of a company, avoiding the analysis of all those subjective economic factors.
0.045802 - Basically, technicians try to identify patterns in price, volume, breadth and trading activities, believing that these informations are enough to determine future values.
0.053381 - Technical indicators, which are mathematical formulas applied to price or volume data, are built and used in order to model some aspect of stock prices or indices movement (Teixeira & Oliveira, 2010).
0.042885 - Technical analysis uses charting, relative strength index, moving averages, on balance volumes, momentum and rate of change, directional movement indicators, among several others as tools for market analysis (Lam, 2004; Tsinaslanidis & Kugiumtzis, 2014).
0.069808 - Based on several technical indicators, technicians organize and analyze historical data of a stock or market index sequentially spread in time in order to predict future values of the financial asset, believing that they tend to repeat itself.
0.036745 - However, despite the flexibility in this approach when compared to fundamental analysis, some authors argue that it cannot help investors decision-making.
0.047904 - Early in 1964, Godfrey, Granger, and Morgenstern (1964) proposed the hypothesis that stock prices present a random walk behavior, in which successive changes in price behave as independent, identically distributed random variables.
0.033613 - That theory implies that price changes have no memory and the past cannot be used to predict future prices effectively.
0.028630 - The Efficient Market Hypothesis (Fama, 1965) supports that theory by stating that prices immediately incorporate all available information about an stock, and only new information is able to change price movements.
0.058608 - As the arrival of new information is unpredictable, so are the price changes.
0.044150 - Since the technical analysis is based on historical data to predict future prices, it could be concluded that this market analysis approach cannot work effectively (Vanstone & Finnie, 2009).
0.055866 - However, regardless of these theories, several investors, financial economists and brokerage firms have used technical analysis in predicting stock market with considerable success (González, García-Crespo, Palacios, Guldrís-Iglesias, & Berbís, 2011).
0.076739 - In 1995, Lui and Mole (1998) conducted a questionnaire to survey the use of technical and fundamental analysis by foreign exchange dealers in Hong Kong.
0.040404 - The results showed that 85% of the responders rely on both fundamental and technical analysis.
0.019753 - Results showed also that technical analysis was more frequently considered in investments at shorter horizons and more useful in forecasting trends and turning points.
0.045348 - Several scientific papers in the literature have used technical analysis to solve the stock market prediction problem (Aghabozorgi & Teh, 2014; Evans, Pappas, & Xhafa, 2013; González et al., 2011; Li, Deng, & Luo, 2009; Martinez, da Hora, de M Palotti, Meira, & Pappa, 2009).
0.056771 - Traditional statistical and soft computing mechanisms An important advantage of using technical analysis is that it simplifies the problem of predicting future market movements to a pattern recognition problem, in which inputs are derived from historical prices and technical indices and outputs can be estimated from these past data (Teixeira & Oliveira, 2010).
0.076739 - As a consequence, several alternatives to approach the problem have been proposed, which range from traditional statistical modeling to methods based on computational intelligence algorithms.
0.056225 - Both approaches generally model the financial data as a time series.
0.054201 - A time series is a sequence of numerical data observations recorded sequentially in time (Brockwell & Davis, 2009; Wang et al., 2012).
0.045714 - Several dynamic processes can be characterized as a time series, such as stock prices (Fig 1), monthly sells of a company, a company payroll, the temperature of a city, electricity consumption, electrocardiogram, among others.
0.058700 - Organizing financial data as a time series allows modeling the time series behavior and predicting future behavior of the time series by using several time series tools (Oliveira & Meira, 2006).
0.022676 - These tools provide easier ways to perform time series data mining tasks, such as identification of trends, presence of seasonal effects, cycles and outliers (Cryer & Chan, 2008).
0.013605 - All these features extracted from financial time series can be used to define buying and selling points, which can be used to maximize investors profits (Murphy, 1999).
0.000000 - Fig 1.
0.000000 - Brazilian oil company stock price time series.
0.044990 - The prediction problem for financial time series data consists in learning a model from a given financial time series data set, where is a data observation and is the predicted value.
0.052758 - The learned model is used to make accurate predictions of y’s for future and unknown values of x’s (Yang, Huang, King, & Lyu, 2009).
0.039216 - However, this problem is considered one of the most challenging problems of modern time series forecasting (Wang et al., 2012).
0.084469 - In the last decades, several approaches have been proposed in order to predict financial time series and to provide decision-making support systems (Teixeira & Oliveira, 2010).
0.049383 - Two major classes of work on forecasting financial time series are the traditional statistical models and the machine learning approaches (Wang et al., 2011).
0.040580 - Traditional statistical models are generally based on the assumption of linearity among normally distributed variables (Wang et al., 2011).
0.000000 - These models include time series regression, exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and its variations, generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), among others (Lin et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012).
0.058957 - These techniques generally assume that the time series under study is generated from a linear process and try to model the underlying process based on this assumption.
0.043165 - However, some specific characteristics of financial time series make this kind of data more difficult to predict, when compared with other kinds of time series.
0.060020 - These specific characteristics make traditional statistical methods not effectively applied to financial context.
0.051282 - Financial time series present an abundance of uncertainty and noise (Vanstone & Finnie, 2009).
0.047244 - Furthermore, this kind of data presents a nonlinear behavior and no identical statistical properties may be observed at each point of time.
0.037098 - Besides, dynamic changes in the relationship between independent and dependent variables happen frequently in financial time series (Hsu, Hsieh, Chih, & Hsu, 2009).
0.063345 - Another aggravating factor that makes prediction of future financial values harder is the high volatility in the time series (Atsalakis & Valavanis, 2009).
0.062570 - Volatility in the financial context can be defined as the intensity of the fluctuations in the market pricing of a financial asset and it is intrinsically related to investment risks (Tung & Quek, 2011).
0.043551 - This inherent characteristic of financial time series can be explained by the fact that financial prices are influenced by many economic factors, investors psychology and expectations, movement of other stock markets, political events, among others (Kara, Acar Boyacioglu, & Baykan, 2011).
0.043245 - Since financial markets are considered complex, evolutionary, noisy, and nonlinear and non-parametric dynamic system (Huang & Tsai, 2009), more adaptive and flexible mechanisms are required to improve forecasting accuracy.
0.087210 - With the recent advances in soft computing techniques, some computational intelligence mechanisms have been used as tools in forecasting financial markets (Lin et al., 2012).
0.071134 - Soft computing techniques, such as expert systems, fuzzy systems and artificial neural networks, have been applied with relative success in modeling and predicting financial time series (Lee, 2009).
0.084302 - Many of these soft computing techniques are able to capture nonlinear relations among relevant market factors with no prior knowledge or statistical assumptions about the input data (Atsalakis & Valavanis, 2009).
0.054416 - Soft computing mechanisms present several advantages when compared with traditional statistical methods.
0.021390 - They generally exhibit high tolerance to imprecision and perform well in noisy data environments; they are numeric, data-driven, non-parametric and self-adaptive mechanisms; they require less historical data than traditional statistical models (Cheng & Wei, 2014).
0.056220 - According to Liang, Zhang, Xiao, and Chen (2009), it is generally believed that non-parametric methods outperform the parametric methods in predicting future financial market behaviors.
0.074462 - Intelligent trading methodology Despite the fact that several researchers have investigated how to use computational intelligent systems to predict financial market movements, there is no well-established and tested methodology which describes how to create an autonomous trading system (Vanstone & Finnie, 2009).
0.032720 - According to Vanstone and Finnie (2010), the main reason is that successful autonomous trading methods are not communicated to the scientific community, since investors try to keep their intellectual capital saved.
0.157556 - In this section, we attempt to summarize the main components of a forecasting methodology applied to financial markets.
0.145316 - This methodology enumerates the main steps for guiding researchers and practitioners in building an intelligent trading system.
0.128538 - We, however, are not going into detail of the complete architecture of a trading system.
0.114952 - Our purpose is to discuss the main components of an intelligent trading system with the focus on forecasting of financial data.
0.059489 - In the context of general time series prediction using computational intelligence, a common systematic procedure used for forecasting includes the following operational steps (Palit & Popovic, 2006): (i) data preparation, (ii) algorithm definition, (iii) training and (iv) forecasting evaluation.
0.043956 - Data preparation, the first step, consists in preparing data for the learning process.
0.045802 - The main activities on this step are acquisition, preprocessing, normalization, and structuring data, which means the determination of training and test data sets.
0.065651 - The second phase, the algorithm definition, consists in determining the soft computing method to be used for modeling and forecasting the data and the definition of the architecture of the method.
0.058957 - The training phase consists in selecting the training algorithm, adjusting training parameters and executing the training procedure in order to create a model of the learned data.
0.034409 - The last phase, the evaluation, consists in defining the evaluation metrics and in measuring the accuracy of the results obtained by running the trained method on the test dataset.
0.048193 - Fig 2 summarizes these four steps of the conventional forecasting methodology.
0.000000 - Fig 2.
0.000000 - Conventional forecasting methodology.
0.170967 - Some primary studies proposed in the literature have used the conventional forecasting methodology to solve financial market problems.
0.104781 - However, some specific issues of financial markets need to be addressed in order to build a successful intelligent method.
0.050034 - The first main issue of financial markets is the choice of input variables to be modeled by a machine learning method and output signals to be predicted and used in defining the rules to enter and exit the market and by the risk and money management strategies.
0.066066 - Other very important issue of financial problems in comparison to other machine learning problems is the evaluation step.
0.074333 - Since the main goal of an autonomous trading system is to maximize the profit when a applied to real markets, the evaluation step must have as its objective to measure the ability to make profits in a real or simulated trading environment.
0.060215 - These issues need to be addressed, under the penalty of constructing a forecasting method which is not applicable in practice or which can cause severe financial damages to investors.
0.080083 - So, in order to build an intelligent trading method, some steps need to be included in this conventional methodology and some existing steps must be adapted.
0.062643 - In the data preparation step, data to be used for analysis and forecasting are collected and prepared to be modeled by a machine learning method.
0.093209 - In the context of financial market applications, several technical or fundamental input variables are available and the choice of which variables to use is not a straightforward task.
0.037559 - Generally, this choice depends on the investment horizons.
0.050420 - Technical variables are indicated in case of short-term trading, such as daily, weekly or monthly (Evans et al., 2013).
0.081400 - Fundamental inputs are typically used in the case of long-term trading (Vanstone & Finnie, 2009).
0.028070 - Among the technical variables, there are numerous technical artificial indexes that can be used.
0.028070 - Atsalakis and Valavanis (2009) summarize several inputs used in more than 100 scientific papers.
0.080321 - Several computational intelligence methods can be used to automate this phase.
0.054507 - These methods have as main objective the selection or extraction of relevant features from input data in order to improve forecasting of financial signals to be used in trading rules.
0.051780 - Another important sub-phase of data preparation is the selection of output variables to be used.
0.051282 - This can be considered a trivial step in other time series prediction applications such as electrocardiogram, electricity consumption, sales of a company, rainfall records, among others.
0.112530 - In the context of forecasting financial market movements, there are several signals that can be predicted and used by a trade system to define the enter and exit rules.
0.047138 - The most common output signal used in literature is the price for the next day.
0.057260 - Other variables used are the price for the next n days, the relative strength indicator (RSI), a sign of the rise of fall in prices, the next turning points, among others.
0.038369 - After defining the input and output variables to be used in forecasting, the data are acquired, preprocessed to eliminate noise and outliers, normalized and structured.
0.087227 - These structured data are used by a machine learning method in order to learning the market behaviors.
0.073352 - The second, third and fourth phases of the corresponding intelligent trading methodology can be conduced in a similar way to the phases of the conventional forecasting methodology (Fig 2).
0.030534 - In these phases, the forecasting algorithm should be selected and trained for modeling the chosen input data and for forecasting the output signals.
0.084211 - The predicted values are used to evaluate the forecasting accuracy of the proposed approach.
0.000000 - Forecasting evaluation can be performed by using conventional machine learning accuracy measures, such as mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error, among others.
0.046896 - In the financial forecasting methodology, two additional phases need to be incorporated to the traditional methodology, namely (i) the trading strategy and (ii) the money evaluation.
0.079530 - A trading strategy is fed with the predicted signals and uses these values to negotiate in the real-world market based on those expected future values.
0.056140 - According to Chande (1999), a successful trading strategy needs to implement three main features.
0.084084 - The first of them consists of a set of rules which specifies when to enter and exit trades.
0.024922 - These rules use the predicted output signals to identify the best moment to buy or sell stocks.
0.087912 - The main goal of the trading rules is to maximize the financial profits.
0.051222 - In practical terms, it uses the predicted output signals to buy assets which are cheap but which tend to appreciate in the future.
0.059765 - The second feature of a successful trading system is a risk control mechanism, which is a set of rules that protect the invested money, such as stop-loss orders for example Teixeira and Oliveira (2010).
0.030905 - Risk control strategies should define profit objectives in each trade as well as it should define when leaving a non-profit position which does not behave as predicted.
0.057200 - The third feature is the money management mechanism, which manages the position size, i.e., the amount of resources to be used in a trade considering the total capital available and the risk involved in the trade.
0.038095 - It is important to highlight that these three strategies of the trading strategy need to take account of real-world constraints, such as the transaction costs, slippage, volume constraints, splits, order routing, among others.
0.081400 - Further discussion of trading system architectures can be found in Aldridge (2009) and Durenard (2013).
0.077359 - The last added phase is the money evaluation, which consists in accessing the performance of the trading system in terms of making profits in a real market.
0.088547 - This is an important phase, since this evaluation gives guarantees that the proposed expert trading method is able to make profits in the market in an autonomous way.
0.045802 - There are lots of metrics that can be used to evaluate the profit performance, such as annualized return, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, among others.
0.052325 - Vanstone and Finnie (2009) summarize several trading system metrics that can be used for profit evaluation.

0.049758 - After defining the input and output variables to be used for modeling the financial asset and acquiring the input data to be used in training, the application of some preprocessing procedure on these data may be very useful, since they may be used to improve the accuracy of an intelligent predictor in several ways.
0.057325 - Feature selection or extraction methods can be applied to a dataset in order to select the best representative features of the input data which reduces the input dimension and consequently minimizes the training time.
0.019185 - Preprocessing mechanisms can be used to filter irrelevant features and noise from input data or detect and correct outliers, which may improve the forecasting accuracy.
0.032520 - Some preprocessing mechanisms can be used to decompose the input data, in order to divide the modeling problem into smaller subproblems.
0.129328 - In this section we discuss some mechanisms proposed in the literature which perform some kind of preprocessing on input data before the training step.
0.080312 - Feature selection and extraction According to the framework described in Fig 3, the primary activities on defining a computational method able to forecast financial markets is the definition of inputs and outputs of the forecasting model.
0.044818 - Based on that initial definition, a machine learning method is used to model the relation among these inputs and outputs.
0.076049 - An incorrect choice of input variables can lead to a model which does not describe the real behavior of the financial market and which can be considered obsolete in forecasting future movements.
0.115047 - In the literature, proposed approaches differ regarding the number and types of variables used in modeling financial behavior.
0.047904 - Fundamental analysis provides several macro and microeconomic attributes of an individual company and of the whole market, such as size of firm, capitalization, price-earnings ratio, cash flow, leverage, profitability, among others.
0.046122 - Technical analysis, on the other hand, provides a bunch of technical attributes, such as moving averages, volatility, on balance volume, momentum, relative strength index, among several others (Vanstone & Finnie, 2009).
0.073005 - However, in the literature, there is no consensus on which input variables are the best to be used.
0.069565 - The selection of which input variables are more representative and useful for effective forecasting is not a straightforward task.
0.056140 - Some of these variables can be redundant and/or irrelevant to the modeling task.
0.058700 - In order to help in deciding which variable set is better suited to a financial forecasting context, some work have investigated the use of automatic feature selection or extraction mechanisms.
0.031189 - The main advantage of feature selection or feature extraction is dimensionality reduction, which consequently reduces the computational efforts of the machine learning method used as well as it reduces the risk of overfitting.
0.058608 - The elimination of irrelevant features leads to better prediction performances (Tsai & Hsiao, 2010).
0.026936 - According to Webb (2003), there is an important distinction about feature selection and feature extraction.
0.041995 - Feature selection mechanisms, also called feature subset selection, identify those variables that are not relevant for modeling the data to be learned.
0.040712 - Feature extraction mechanisms, on the other hand, try to find a transformation from the original feature set to a lower-dimensional feature space.
0.040580 - Feature selection and extraction methods can be classified as filters and wrappers, according to the operation of the method.
0.038835 - Filter methods perform the selection of important features independent of any machine learning method (Lee, 2009).
0.040712 - These methods generally work by direct analysis of the input data, and operate by estimating important features through some statistics over the data.
0.030030 - Methods as discriminant analysis, stepwise selection, principal component analysis (PCA) are examples of mechanisms used as filter methods.
0.051780 - Wrapper methods, on the other hand, rely on a machine learning algorithm to select important features.
0.057554 - These methods use the classification performance of a given learning algorithm in order to evaluate how good is a subset of features used as input.
0.049844 - Such methods work by searching the best subset of input features, trying to optimize the predictor accuracy.
0.047312 - Despite the fact that wrappers perform better, since they work directly with the accuracy measures of a given classifier, they have high computational costs (Lin, Liang, Yeh, & Huang, 2014).
0.016064 - As the feature space increases, the search space may become intractable.
0.047138 - Filter methods generally lead to a lower accuracy, however they present a higher computational scalability.
0.084192 - Lee (2009) proposed a hybrid feature selection mechanism that takes the advantages of filter and wrapper methods, namely the lower computational costs and better accuracy, respectively.
0.066158 - An F-score measure is used as a filter in order to help in deciding the best subsets for a given feature set.
0.046122 - Next, a support vector machine (SVM) classifier is used as a wrapper prediction method to refine the initial selection provided by the filter, which produces a reduced set of features.
0.050891 - Tsai and Hsiao (2010) used the ensemble technique to build a feature selector, which combines PCA, GA and Classification and Regression Decision Trees.
0.028777 - The authors compared the feature selector ensemble using three combination strategies, namely union, intersection and multi-intersection of the features selected by each individual selector.
0.000000 - Lin et al.
0.064202 - (2014) combined expert knowledge with a GA-based wrapper to select the best features to financial distress prediction problem.
0.069565 - A set of financial features is pre-classified using expert knowledge, and features are grouped into some major categories.
0.022409 - The idea behind grouping features is to reduce the search space, by eliminating highly correlated features from the search space.
0.033755 - An SVM algorithm is used as the wrapper prediction model.
0.039982 - De-noising and outlier detection Real-world applications of machine learning typically face the presence of noise and outliers in the input data (Chuang, Su, Jeng, & Hsiao, 2002).
0.053640 - Noise and outliers are observations considerably different from the remainder of data.
0.030534 - Noise can be caused by several reasons, typically derived from failures in collecting data, due to mechanical faults, human error or instrument error.
0.026247 - Outliers can appear on the data due some abnormal situations, such as system behavior, fraudulent behavior or natural deviations in data population.
0.060060 - Since these observations are inconsistent with the remainder of data, they may cause several damage in modeling data.
0.059570 - In the financial context, the presence of noise and outliers can cause poor data modeling and lead to poor forecasting, consequently (Grané & Veiga, 2010).
0.070483 - In the literature, some authors have investigated how to filter noise from data, detect outliers and correct them as a preprocessing step in the financial context.
0.027923 - Some work have used independent component analysis (ICA) to identify independent components of a data set which present normal behavior and filter then from noise (Dai, Wu, & Lu, 2012; Kao, Chiu, Lu, & Yang, 2013; Lu et al., 2009).
0.000000 - Lu et al.
0.086957 - (2009) proposed the use of nonlinear ICA (NICA) in combination with support vector regression (SVR) to predict stock prices.
0.079530 - NICA is a variant of the ICA which assumes that data are a nonlinear combination of latent source signals, which are more suitable to financial data.
0.040712 - Independent components that contain less informations about the main features of the original time series are considered noise and filtered from the data.

0.040404 - In that work, WT is used to remove noise from data before the learning process.
0.013468 - An index closing price time series is decomposed using low-pass and high-pass filters.
0.028777 - Data filtered by the low-pass filter represent the main data of the signal, whereas data filtered by the high-pass filter represent the noise.
0.053872 - Then the low frequency data are used to train an MLP using the backpropagation algorithm.
0.052174 - Lu (2010) compared the performance of ICA and WT in filtering input data from noise before modeling financial data.
0.036281 - The comparison involved the following approaches: (i) ICA in combination with MLP, (ii) WT in combination with MLP, (iii) a single MLP and (iv) the random walk.
0.061303 - Results showed a better accuracy of ICA + MLP followed by WT + MLP.
0.051780 - Grané and Veiga (2010) investigated the use of WT as an outlier detection and correction method.
0.090040 - The proposed method can be applied to the residuals of different volatility models whose error may follow any known distribution.
0.058700 - Authors tested the proposed method in several volatility models, such as GARCH and the autoregressive stochastic volatility model (ARSV), with errors following a Gaussian or a Student’s t distribution.

0.115719 - In the proposed approach, a Voronoi diagram is constructed for the dataset.
0.052846 - Then, the Voronoi average distance, which measures the average distance for each point to its nearest neighbors in the diagram, is computed.
0.018648 - The points with larger Voronoi average distance are considered outliers, since they differ significantly from the other points and can be eliminated from the input dataset.
0.022409 - Time series segmentation Financial time series data comprise numerous historical data points, which are typically dynamic and nonlinear by nature.
0.051780 - This characteristic makes harder the trend analysis task as well as the prediction of future values.
0.077620 - A common technique used in the literature as a dimension reduction tool is the segmentation of the time series (Li et al., 2009; Yin, Si, & Gong, 2011).
0.047904 - Segmentation is a preprocessing step usually used for representing the time series with less data, which allows the identification of technical patterns easier than by analyzing the whole data (Si & Yin, 2013).
0.058838 - Some common segmentation methods applied to financial time series are perceptually important points (PIP) and turning points (TP) identification.
0.050314 - Both methods have been used to identify some significant points of a financial time series and they use these important points to represent the whole series without loss of information.
0.048309 - This idea is based on the fact that fluctuations, trends and patterns within a time series are reflected by only a small number of data points, which themselves are able to preserve the overall shape of the time series (Si & Yin, 2013).
0.047597 - By using just these important points, an intelligent system can model and predict the time series with less effort and improve accuracy.
0.040404 - In Si and Yin (2013), PIPs are selected from the original time series as follows.
0.035556 - The first and last observations are defined as PIPs.
0.049844 - The subsequent PIPs are iteratively computed as the point with maximum distance to the previously identified PIPs.

0.044818 - PIPs are used to identify significant data points which are used to segment the series into different subsequences of data.
0.036129 - DTW is then used to find similar historical subsequences and make predictions based on the manner that these best matches evolve in the past, believing that similar behaviors would happen in future.
0.044150 - Turning points are basically local minimum and maximum points on a time series, or in practical terms, the peaks and troughs (Li et al., 2009; Si & Yin, 2013).
0.047597 - TPs can be considered landmarks in the time series and can be interpreted as events of great importance in the underlying process.
0.050314 - TPs indicate the change of the financial time series during a period, which can be used to identify the beginning or end of a transaction period (Yin et al., 2011).

0.024922 - Grouping similar time series is very useful to help in predicting stock prices and make profitable investments.
0.051659 - Aghabozorgi and Teh (2014) proposed a clustering method which is able to identify time series that are similar in shape, even if they are dissimilar in time, i.e., they are co-moving but with some shifts or daily lead–lag relationships.
0.084507 - The proposed cluster method operates in three phases.
0.056311 - In the first step, time series are preprocessed, transformed in a low dimensional space and then grouped using the k-modes clustering method.

0.052607 - The first distance measure used in the clustering algorithm is based on the autoregressive representation of the GARCH model.
0.051780 - This distance metric computes the dissimilarity between each pair of time series by comparing autoregressive coefficients.
0.054321 - The second distance measure proposed is based on a parametric approach that uses the information about the estimated GARCH parameters and their estimated covariances.

0.000000 - (2009).
0.072235 - In that work, the authors proposed a two-stage architecture to predict stock index time series composed by a self-organizing map (SOM) and SVR.

0.151043 - In this section, we discuss the more common soft computing techniques applied in forecasting financial time series.
0.082026 - Artificial neural networks In the last decades, ANNs have become very popular in the context of financial market forecasting.
0.050682 - The main reason for the wide use of ANNs in these problems is because these mechanisms are able to handle data characterized by nonlinearities, discontinuities and high-frequency polynomial components (Liu & Wang, 2012).

0.066158 - This is due to the fact that technical analysis works directly with quantitative, objective attributes of the market, which are in numerical format.
0.091954 - This makes easier the modeling of market behaviors with computational intelligence approaches.
0.050420 - Fundamentalists have to handle qualitative, subjective data related with macro and microeconomic, which may difficult the modeling of market behavior.
0.068754 - However, despite some additional difficulties, some primary studies have investigated the use of web news, tweets, financial reports and other inputs presented in textual format, considering the sentiment of authors as a relevant feature.
0.056075 - These researches typically investigate the use of text mining mechanisms to extract useful information from these data.
0.072829 - The important features of the texts are generally modeled as a time series and used to train a forecaster method.
0.060606 - The last column of the table reinforces our argument which states the need of the last step of our proposed financial forecasting methodology: the money evaluation.
0.108336 - The majority of investigated primary studies provide no profit evaluation in their proposed forecasting approaches.
0.071578 - This last step is important in the sense of giving some empirical guarantee that the proposed method can be used in real-world.
0.051780 - Without this evaluation step, investors, students and other practitioners cannot completely trust on these proposed mechanisms.

0.079093 - (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
0.084075 - Over the past decades, there has been a growing interest in designing soft computing mechanisms for the analysis and forecasting of several financial market segments, such as exchange rates, stock prices, commodities prices, financial distress prediction, among others.
0.081301 - However, despite the fact that this is not a new research area, several challenges remain as open problems in this literature.
0.106667 - In this section we discuss some of these challenges.
0.049018 - Deep learning and financial markets Recently, the attention of the machine learning and pattern recognition communities has been devoted to applying different methods to hierarchically learn useful features from a large amount of data (Bengio, Courville, & Vincent, 2013).
0.037296 - The main goal of these approaches is to model complex real-world data by extracting robust features that capture the relevant information (Hinton, Osindero, & Teh, 2006).
0.050392 - The extraction and recognition of the patterns occur through a deep nonlinear network topology, in which the layers of feature representations can be stacked to create deep networks capable of modeling complex structures in the data (Le Roux & Bengio, 2008).
0.030342 - The deep learning approach has been successfully applied to tasks such as classification (Lee, Grosse, Ranganath, & Ng, 2009), speech recognition (Zhang & Wu, 2013) and dimensionality reduction (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006).
0.008386 - The mainstream deep machine learning approaches include convolutional neural networks (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, & Hinton, 2012), deep belief networks (Hinton et al., 2006) and stacked auto-encoders (Vincent, Larochelle, Bengio, & Manzagol, 2008).
0.090090 - However, the application of deep leaning methods to the field of financial forecasting remains a relatively unexplored area.
0.037296 - The main challenge here is to investigate if deep architectures can be adapted to enhance trading patterns recognition and decrease the overall risk for trading strategies.
0.087383 - A relevant work on deep learning applied to finance was proposed by Yoshihara, Fujikawa, Seki, and Uehara (2014) where the combination of Restricted Boltzmann Machine and deep belief network was applied for dealing with the temporal effects in market data.
0.071942 - This work proposed an approach to predict the trend of stock prices from Nikkei Stock Exchange by focusing on news events with long-term effects.
0.048309 - The same problem was approached in Ding, Zhang, Liu, and Duan (2015), where a combination of neural tensor network and a deep convolutional neural network was presented to model both short-term and long-term influences of events on stock price movements.
0.084379 - Recently, a novel method for forecasting exchange rates was proposed in Shen, Chao, and Zhao (2015) by combining an improved deep belief network and a conjugate gradient method.
0.047962 - In that work, a comparison with traditional feedforward neural network was performed and the results showed that the deep learning approach outperforms the traditional methods.
0.053170 - The main challenge to apply deep learning methods for financial forecasting is the modeling of complex, high-dimensional, and noisy real-world time series through a deep representation of the data.
0.032787 - Some approaches to deep learning on tasks such as time series modeling are presented in Kuremoto, Kimura, Kobayashi, and Obayashi (2014), where a predictor is constructed by a deep belief network with two Restricted Boltzmann Machines.
0.054507 - This approach was evaluated by the modeling of chaotic time series and the prediction results showed that the proposed method provided higher forecasting precision when compared with MLP and ARIMA.
0.100202 - In general, an important contribution and future direction for the field of financial time series forecasting is to investigate if stacked structures can be applied to capture trading patterns in raw data.
0.060060 - The problem of deep representations for time series is similar to the unsupervised feature learning for static data.
0.027211 - In Längkvist, Karlsson, and Loutfi (2014), some relevant methods for feature learning in deep networks were reviewed and their application for time series domain was investigated.
0.066719 - Despite the fact that unsupervised feature learning has been successfully applied in tasks such as computer vision, its application for financial data is not prevalent in the literature.
0.051780 - The main challenge here is to apply dimensionality reduction techniques with no losses of valuable information.
0.062643 - Thus, the feature learning methods for financial time series have to be adapted in order to adjust the temporal information generated by the financial markets.
0.059902 - Since additional information from sources that affect the stock market can be obtained and disposed into hierarchical layers, a future direction for time series prediction is the application of deep learning methods to learn features that related just at some past values of the stock itself.
0.064762 - A similar approach is presented in Qiu, Zhang, Ren, Suganthan, and Amaratunga (2015), where an ensemble of deep belief network combined with support vector regression was applied in benchmark datasets for time series forecasting.
0.074658 - Since this method has not been applied directly to financial data, a future direction for research is to investigate if the aggregate output of different deep structures, such as deep belief networks or stacked auto-encoders, can be used to improve the forecast precision.
0.062643 - Portfolio management The application of machine learning methods for financial market have been closely tied up with the task of predicting values for financial assets.
0.048048 - However, the use of these methods for portfolio management has attracted the attention of the machine learning community.
0.055041 - Typically, the portfolios are constructed via taking expected stock returns and then applying some optimization process (Irlicht, 2014), such as proposed in the classical work of Markowitz (1952), or by estimating regression coefficients using earnings expectations data, price momentum variables, and reported financial data (Guerard, Markowitz, & Xu, 2015).
0.058480 - When considering machine learning for portfolio management, one can refer to the use of association rule mining and fuzzy logic in order to build a list of recommended assets (Paranjape-Voditel & Deshpande, 2013).
0.012461 - Furthermore, fuzzy logic can be combined with technical indicators to support portfolio construction decisions (Yunusoglu & Selim, 2013).
0.054054 - Despite the use of association and fuzzy rule based models, there are other methods employed in portfolio applications.
0.070938 - In Liao and Chou (2013), data mining techniques are combined with association rules and clustering analysis in order to investigate the co-movement of financial markets and the resulting model is used for portfolio recommendation.
0.098189 - The work presented in Chourmouziadis and Chatzoglou (2016) highlights an intelligent short term stock trading fuzzy system for portfolio management, in which soft computing techniques are combined with technical indicators for the selection of a set of assets.
0.085655 - A challenge and future direction in portfolio management research is to investigate the use of novel machine learning methods for optimal assets selection, including the combination of time series forecasting with sequential learning, as early proposed in Chapados and Bengio (2001).
0.102672 - Concept drift and financial markets The majority of the primary studies discussed in this paper which are based on technical analysis typically model the technical indices as a historical time series.
0.085770 - By using time series as an abstraction of the complexity of a market, several researches try to build a computational model from the past experience of what has been observed in that market.
0.065268 - In practical terms, the goal of these approaches is to learn a regression model from the historic time series data in order to forecast future values.
0.046901 - However, despite the fact that there is a vast literature on time series analysis, the majority of the existing approaches does not take into consideration that a financial time series is a special kind of data stream (Cavalcante & Oliveira, 2015).
0.061350 - Most of these researches are based on the assumption that time series concepts are stationary in such a way that the time series observations follow a fixed and immutable probability distribution.
0.064257 - This assumption, however, may not hold for several financial time series.
0.043989 - For example, the time series of stock prices of a company may change its behavior due to changes in political and economical factors or due to changes in the investors psychology or expectations; the time series of a currency exchange pair may change due to changes in government exchange rates policy.
0.070175 - As a special case of data stream, financial time series frequently have concept drift.
0.044756 - Concept drift consists in a change in the relation between input data and the target variable over time (Gama, Žliobaitė, Bifet, Pechenizkiy, & Bouchachia, 2014).
0.054201 - This evolution imposes a big challenge to traditional batch learning algorithms, since the model learned from the data can become obsolete.
0.070838 - There is a very high risk involved in using an outdated prediction model in financial markets, which can cause financial damage.
0.044444 - However, just a few researches have investigated the concept drift problem in financial time series and how to handle it in order to keep the learned model up-to-date and able to make accurate predictions during its operation.
0.016064 - Concept drift has been widely studied in classification problems (Gama, 2012).
0.039506 - The methods proposed for handling concept drift can be divided into two main groups: (1) implicit or blinding methods and (2) explicit detection methods.
0.052174 - Implicit methods are those that update the decision model in regular intervals, independent of the occurrence of concept drifts.
0.047244 - The main issue with these approaches is that they are not transparent to the user, since they work as a black-box.
0.022599 - According to Zliobaite et al.
0.030651 - (2012), real-world applications require reliable and transparent methods to the user.
0.076635 - Informing the user when a concept drift occurs may increase the trust in the prediction process, mainly in financial market applications.
0.057971 - In a very recent work, Cavalcante and Oliveira (2015) investigated the concept drift effects in financial time series prediction.
0.072829 - Two explicit drift detection tests originally proposed for classification problems were adapted to handle the financial time series forecasting problem.
0.088134 - These tests were combined with a batch learning algorithm to build an adaptive learning system.
0.037296 - When the concept drift test detects a concept drift, the batch decision model is retrained with the time series observations which belong to the new concept.
0.069136 - The experimental results of that work showed that the proposed adaptive forecasting method which considers concept drift improved the forecasting of financial time series.
0.098793 - An interesting way to go further in this research branch is the investigation of intelligent trading systems that combine explicit drift detection, adaptive learning systems and trading rules for automatic negotiation.
0.046620 - These trading rules should take concept drifts into consideration during the real-world negotiation in order to avoid extra risks due to periods of concept changes.
