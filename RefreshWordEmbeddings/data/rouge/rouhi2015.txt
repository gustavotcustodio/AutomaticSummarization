CNN templates are generated using a genetic algorithm to segment mammograms. An adaptive threshold is computed in region growing process by using ANN and intensity features. In tumor classification, CNN produces better results than region growing. MLP produces the highest classification accuracy among other classifiers. Results on DDSM images are more appropriate than those of MIAS.

0.042328 - Breast cancer is regarded as one of the most frequent mortality causes among women.
0.060241 - As early detection of breast cancer increases the survival chance, creation of a system to diagnose suspicious masses in mammograms is important.
0.073059 - In this paper, two automated methods are presented to diagnose mass types of benign and malignant in mammograms.
0.114321 - In the first proposed method, segmentation is done using an automated region growing whose threshold is obtained by a trained artificial neural network (ANN).
0.101849 - In the second proposed method, segmentation is performed by a cellular neural network (CNN) whose parameters are determined by a genetic algorithm (GA).
0.081761 - Intensity, textural, and shape features are extracted from segmented tumors.
0.088154 - GA is used to select appropriate features from the set of extracted features.
0.106870 - In the next stage, ANNs are used to classify the mammograms as benign or malignant.
0.060241 - To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods different classifiers (such as random forest, naïve Bayes, SVM, and KNN) are used.
0.099174 - Results of the proposed techniques performed on MIAS and DDSM databases are promising.
0.049020 - The obtained sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rates are 96.87%, 95.94%, and 96.47%, respectively.
0.041667 - According to American cancer society (ACS), about 40,030 breast cancer deaths are predicted in USA in 2013 (39,620 women and 410 men).
0.068783 - Breast cancer is referred to an abnormal multiplication of cells in the breast tissue.
0.052910 - It is the second most common cause of deaths in women after lung cancer.
0.036530 - Since 1989, the breast cancer mortality rates have declined sharply in young women under 50 years of age.
0.018265 - Such reduced mortality rates can be associated with the early detection and effective treatments (American Cancer Society, 2013).
0.070922 - Generally, there are several types of abnormalities in mammograms such as masses and micro-calcifications (Kopans, 1998).
0.049383 - Masses are attributed to any lesion, lump, or protuberance in the breast and micro-calcifications are calcium deposits due to secretion of milk glands in the breast appearing in clusters or individuals.
0.047281 - The size of individual micro-calcifications can be ranged from twenty to hundreds of microns in diameter.
0.057348 - Since micro-calcifications have higher contrast than masses in mammograms, detection and diagnosis of masses is a more challenging problem (Bator & Nieniewski, 2012; Vyborny & Giger, 1994).
0.050553 - Recent developments in digital mammography imaging systems have aimed to better diagnosis of abnormalities in the breast (Winsberg, Elkin, Macy, Bordaz, & Weymouth, 1967) and have increased the survival chance (Akay, 2009).
0.066335 - Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are sets of automatic or semi-automatic tools using computer technology to help radiologists with detection and classification of breast abnormalities (Freer & Ulissey, 2001).
0.062893 - As a result, CAD systems seem appealing to the radiologists.
0.073529 - Generally, a CAD system consists of segmentation, feature extraction and classification stages (Tahmasbi, Saki, & Shokouhi, 2011).
0.066253 - Efficient segmentation of mammograms in which the main characteristics of tumors, especially boundaries, are preserved can successfully influence the consequent stages.
0.091719 - The main contribution of this paper is proposing two segmentation approaches based on the improvement of region growing and CNN with respect to preserve tumor boundary information to diagnose benign and malignancy in mammograms.
0.102102 - In mammograms there are two regions of breast and non-breast.
0.058201 - To diagnose masses, the region of interest (ROI) is cropped from the breast area.
0.066661 - Pixels inside masses usually have the highest intensity in an ROI.
0.000000 - They usually present visually continuous variation.
0.090917 - So, these characteristics imply a region growing procedure to segment masses in ROIs (Wei, Chen, & Liu, 2012).
0.099927 - Region growing method is a region-based segmentation in which masses are segmented by grouping similar neighboring pixels of seed points.
0.055846 - For example, if a similarity measure of the two adjacent pixels is greater than a threshold, these pixels are considered as similar and thus are grouped together.
0.024024 - The grouping of neighboring pixels continues until no similar pixels remain.
0.049910 - Compared to the detection of seed points for an image, selection of an appropriate value for the threshold is a more considerable problem; because the threshold can affect preserving the boundary information of the masses and benign and malignancy diagnosis (Cao, Hao, Zhu, & Xia, 2010).
0.072736 - In spite of these problems, during the region growing process (as a region-based method in boundary extraction) the intensity and the spatial and connectivity information are considered; contrary to what happened in pixel- and edge-based methods (Rabottino, Mencattini, Salmeri, Caselli, & Lojacono, 2011).
0.089013 - There are different approaches to improve traditional region growing segmentation, some recent studies are as follows.

0.056385 - Determination of the threshold was done experimentally in which 100 images were tested using different thresholds and then the threshold was set as 1.07 (Wei et al., 2012).
0.064516 - Choosing a constant threshold for all images caused smaller or larger mass segments than the reference mass segment which is called under-and over-segmentation, respectively.
0.080277 - As such, a method is needed to determine an adaptive threshold for each image.
0.000000 - Berber et al.
0.126092 - adjusted region growing to set threshold adaptively by using a produced mass size estimation of intensity histogram in OTSU segmentation (Berber, Alpkocak, Balci, & Dicle, 2013).

0.000000 - Görgel et al.
0.053782 - proposed a local seed region growing (LSRG) method in which the selection of seed points and similarity criterion were determined according to the local and global information (i.e., mean and standard deviation of neighboring pixels 3 × 3, as local and the entire image as global).
0.039216 - Also, to set the threshold, different definitions were introduced and tested (Görgel, Sertbas, & Ucan, 2013).
0.123363 - In Melouah (2013), a training dataset contains the extracted features from images and their corresponding threshold in order to produce an adaptive threshold in region growing was built.
0.086055 - Then, by using a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and the training dataset the threshold of an image was estimated, adaptively.
0.127555 - In the first proposed method of this study, the region growing-based segmentation method is improved by using the extracted intensity features from ROIs and applying the ANN to generate an adaptive threshold.
0.081462 - Because of the high computational cost of region growing method, it is unsuitable for segmenting high resolution images such as mammograms (Rabottino et al., 2011).
0.075269 - Therefore, to overcome this shortcoming, a segmentation method using CNN with hardware accessibility and parallel computing is applied in the second proposed method of this study.

0.000000 - Wang et al.
0.073918 - proposed CNN learning algorithms based on genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for infrared images.
0.066527 - Based on their results, genetic algorithm showed fast convergence compared to PSO, especially for large images (Wang, Yang, Xie, & An, 2014).
0.115832 - In fact, in the second proposed technique, the CNN parameters are set using a genetic algorithm with an attempt to preserve tumor boundary in mammograms segmentation, specially for the images in DDSM and MIAS databases.
0.060606 - In order to evaluate the two proposed methods, the following stages are performed.

0.075923 - As shown in Fig 1, the first method uses region growing algorithm whose required threshold is obtained by a trained neural network as shown in Fig 2 the segmentation of the second method is performed by a cellular neural network whose parameters are determined by genetic algorithm for partitioning the image into meaningful regions.
0.052980 - In order to elaborate more on the proposed methods, this section is divided into several subsections as the following.

0.053763 - To examine the performance of the proposed techniques, we used 93 and 170 images containing malignant and benign masses, respectively, from both MIAS and DDSM databases.
0.063218 - In the following the characteristics of the two applied databases are described.
0.033149 - Mammography imaging analysis society The database is available online on the website http://peipa.essex.ac.uk/info/mias.html for the academic research purposes.
0.025445 - The database contains 161 pairs of mediolateral oblique (MLO) view images with 1024 × 1024 resolution.
0.059696 - The images are taken from a film-screen mammographic imaging of the United Kingdom national breast screening program.
0.030075 - After digitizing the images, they have been annotated based on background tissue (fatty, fatty-glandular and dense glandular), class of abnormality (calcification, well defined, spiculated, architectural distortion, asymmetry, ill-defined, and normal) and severity of abnormality (benign or malignant) by expert radiologists.
0.051724 - Also, the center coordinates of abnormality and its approximate radius are determined.

0.034314 - Also, characteristics of background tissue of abnormalities are divided into fatty, fatty-glandular, and dense-glandular.
0.078215 - Pre-processing In the pre-processing stage first of all, the images are cropped to obtain the ROIs containing abnormality tissues and masses.
0.073316 - This is done by using the existing coordinates corresponding to the center and the approximate radius of each abnormality for MIAS images and the chain code for DDSM images.
0.045802 - Since mammograms are taken under different conditions, they are affected by noise and some artifacts.
0.027397 - Moreover, they usually do not have the desired contrast to perform accurate analyses of the two proposed techniques.
0.043011 - As such, the local area histogram equalization is used (Bick & Diekmann, 2010) and then the median filtering (Mohanty, Senapati, & Lenka, 2013) is applied to suppress noise.

0.101441 - Region growing is a region-based method starting with seed points in the image.
0.024024 - Seeds propagate until the specified stop criteria is satisfied (Zucker, 1976).
0.071141 - Different steps of region growing are presented as the following: (i) Input image = ROI; (x, y) = maximum intensity in ROI; t = produced seed point using trained ANN; mean of region = I(x, y); (ii) Start region growing until the distance between the region intensity mean and new pixels intensity mean become higher than the threshold t. (iii) Add new 4-neighbors pixels.
