0.066114 - Key concept extraction In order to analyze the unstructured parts of problem, it requires the extraction of the key concepts resided in the texts.
0.081967 - Single word is often too general in represent the meanings or ambiguous to represent a concept.
0.015326 - Multi-word phrases can be more specific and desirable.
0.009070 - However, multi-word phrases have no lexical boundaries in texts, which makes them difficult to be identified (Tseng, Lin, & Lin, 2007).
0.082575 - In this paper, a key concept extraction algorithm is developed for extracting multi-word phrases while any corpora, lexicons, or dictionaries are not required.
0.052493 - It makes use of the syntactic structure of the text to find the relations between the words.
0.043716 - The key concepts can be extracted from the text itself rather than retrieved from predefined lexicons.
0.087432 - Hence, it can be used in any knowledge domains without the need for initial knowledge acquisition.
0.091954 - Generally, the subject of a sentence represents a concept.
0.103097 - The object of a sentence, which is in the verbal phrase, represents a second concept.
0.098090 - The algorithm extracts all the noun phrases inside the text and consolidates them into a list of key concepts.
0.021505 - As shown in Figs.
0.071856 - 3 and 4, the unstructured text is first divided into tokens by regular expressions such as the new line character, full stop, question mark, etc.

0.028490 - Each token is merged with its nearby token as noun phrases based on their POS.
0.023810 - If their POS are nouns, adjectives, gerunds, or preposition “of”, then they are merged.
0.036745 - Simple rules are used to deal with spelling variants and syntactic variants as shown in Table 1.
0.028169 - Moreover, it is interesting to note that a longer word string is usually a preferred concept (Tseng et al., 2007).
0.044118 - To obtain a longer word string, the extracted noun phrases are filtered based on the following heuristic rules as follows: • Rule 1: Given two phrases t1 and t2, if t2 matches t1 and t1 is additionally modified by certain terms or adjectives, then t2 is removed.
0.050725 - For example, t1 = “credit card”, t2 = “card”, t2 is removed.
0.050314 - • Rule 2: Given two phrases t1 and t2, if t2’s alphabet letters matches the first letters of words of t1, then t2 is considered as the abbreviation of t1 and t2 is removed.
0.061856 - For example, t1 = “natural language processing”, t2 = “NLP”, t2 is removed.

0.048780 - Similarity analysis is developed based on this idea.
0.068241 - It searches for similar cases by quantifying the cases in order to calculate the similarity among cases.
0.042606 - In the present study, the similarity between the new problem and the old cases is determined by the nearest neighbor matching (Aamodt & Plaza, 1994) as shown by Eq (1) (1) where m is the number of fields, wj is the weighting of the jth field, and are value of the jth field of the input problem and that of the old cases, is the similarity function for the jth field.
0.088333 - In the present study, the similarity between the fields of unstructured texts is determined by the similarity between the key concepts of the unstructured texts.
0.027915 - The similarity is calculated by Eq (2) (2) where vi and vr are key concept lists of the jth field of the input problem and that of the retrieved case, respectively; vijn is the key concept n in the concept list vij; |vij ∩ vrj| is the number of concepts jointly appearing in vij and vrj; |vij ∩ vrj| is the number of unique concepts in vij and vrj, concepts are considered as similar if they are identical, or they satisfy the condition in Rule 1 or Rule 2 that mentioned Section 3.1.
0.081874 - After determining the similarities of the old cases in the repository, the case with the highest similarity is retrieved as the recommendation for the inputted problem.
0.023870 - Association analysis Contrast to similarity analysis, cognitive psychology stated that people do not learn by memorizing, instead, they learn by summarizing, relating, and organizing concepts into their cognitive structures (Ausubel, 1963).
0.043716 - New knowledge is assimilated into their cognitive structures through construction and not merely acquired (Novak, 1990).
0.060962 - It has been proven that the cognitive structures can be constructed by the association analysis of transactional cases in terms of maps or networks, and it sometime performs better than that for the similarity analysis (Wang, Cheung, Lee, & Kwok, 2008).
