The study is new in Iran. ► Propose an ANN model to predict bankruptcy of companies. Many learning algorithms have been tested. ► Three models; ANN, GA, and MDA, are utilized. ANN model outperforms the other two models.

0.208791 - The purpose of this study is to design a model to predict financial health of companies.
0.052696 - Financial ratios for 180 manufacturing companies quoted in Tehran Stock Exchange for one year (year ended March 21, 2008) have been used.
0.188434 - Three models; based on artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic algorithm (GA), and multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) are utilized to classify the bankrupt from non bankrupt corporations.
0.128205 - ANN model achieved 98.6% and 96.3% accuracy rates in training and holdout samples, respectively.
0.114695 - To evaluate the reliability of the model, the data were examined with genetic algorithm and Multivariate discriminate analysis method.
0.078421 - GA model attained only 92.5% and 91.5% accuracy rates and MDA reached 80.6% and 79.9 in training and holdout samples, respectively.
0.091193 - Bankruptcy and failure of companies is an unwanted phenomenon which is always an important problem.
0.087302 - Prediction of corporate financial distress has long been the object of study of corporate finance literature.
0.055556 - Business failures in general, have serious negative economic and social consequences, therefore should be seriously treated.
0.087302 - The impact of bankruptcy is often the object of research by bank economist and government officers.
0.035088 - Economic cost of business failures is significant.
0.053872 - It affects the national economy as a whole, influencing the trends of major economic indicators such as sales, exports and production.
0.040936 - Furthermore every company, to a greater or lesser degree and in difficult ways, influences and is influenced by various stakeholders like investors, customers, employees and suppliers.
0.069444 - Hence, the suppliers of capital, investors and creditors, as well as management and employees, are severely affected by business failures.
0.088889 - Models of bankruptcy prediction will also help a manager to keep track of a company’s performance over a number of years and will help identify important trends.
0.092141 - The models may not specifically tell the manager what is wrong, but it should encourage them to identify problems and take effective action to minimize the incidence of failure.
0.111111 - A predictive model may warn an auditor of a company’s vulnerability.
0.104233 - In addition, lenders may adopt use predictive models to aid in assessing a company defaulting on its loan.
0.080000 - Regulatory agencies are concerned whether a monitored company is in danger of failing.
0.090045 - In Iran in general and especially in the level of listed companies in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) there are many companies which suffer from weakness of financial health or in other words they are bankrupt.
0.044444 - As an example, some companies cannot pay their liabilities and their inadequate return could not cover their expenses.
0.063492 - Therefore they are incorporated under the trade act 141.
0.069444 - According to this act the companies are known as bankrupt whose retained losses are more than 50% of their capital.
0.071685 - If this financial failing be discovered sooner the chance of cure and recovery with simple methods will be higher.
0.057143 - So it is recommended that instead of bankruptcy, weakness of financial health be used as it has been used interchangeably in this paper.
0.042735 - Prediction of corporate financial health from financial data is a well-known research topic.
0.111111 - One of the first researchers to study bankruptcy prediction is Beaver (1966).
0.083333 - He examined the predictability of the 14 financial ratios using 158 samples that consisted of bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies.
0.078853 - Altman’s (1968, 1983) pursued Beaver’s study based on the MDA to identify the companies into recognized classes.
0.072072 - According to Altman’s model, bankruptcy could be explained totally by using a combination of five financial ratios out of original list of 22 ratios.
0.088889 - The classification of Altman’s model based on the value obtained for the Z score has a predictive power of 96% for prediction one year prior to bankruptcy.
0.053872 - These used statistical methods, however, have some limiting assumptions such as the linearity, normality and independence among predictor or input variables.
0.000000 - Financial data often violates these assumptions for independent variables (Deakin, 1972).
0.092593 - Hence the methods can have limitations to obtain the effectiveness and validity.
0.071685 - In recent times, a number of studies have confirmed that artificial intelligence approaches are less exposed to these assumptions.
0.074437 - Among these methods ANNs can be substitute methods for classification problems to these conventional statistical methods which have been practiced for a long time.
0.128205 - ANNs are competent of recognizing and presenting non-linear relations in the data set.
0.061404 - Therefore they have been studied widely in financial problems studies including bankruptcy prediction (Barniv, Agarwal, & Leach, 1997; Bell, 1997; Shin, Shin, & Han, 1998; Zhang, Hu, Patuwo, & Indro, 1999).
0.144444 - ANNs basically are different from parametric statistical models.
0.085470 - In case of parametric statistical models the user should specify the nature of the functional relationship such as linear or logistic between the dependent and independent variables.
0.066066 - After preparing an assumption about the functional form, optimization methods are used to decide on a set of parameters which reduces the measure of error.
0.081633 - On the contrary, ANNs with at least one hidden layer are capable of using data to expand an interior illustration of the relationships between variables in away that previous assumptions about primary parameter distributions are not vital.
0.099415 - As a result, better outcomes might be predictable with ANNs when the relationship between the variables does not fit the implicit model (Salchenberger, Cinar, & Lash, 1992).
0.115556 - Odom and Sharda (1990) use ANNs for bankruptcy prediction for the first time.
0.077778 - Their model had five input variables similar to Altman’s study (Altman, 1968) and had one hidden layer with five nodes and one node for the output layer.
0.051852 - They took 65 bankrupt companies and 64 non-bankrupt companies as the research sample between 1975 and 1982.
0.050926 - Among these 74 companies (38 bankrupt and 36 non-bankrupt companies) were used to form the training set, while the remaining 55 companies (27 bankrupt and 28 non-bankrupt companies) were used to make holdout sample.
0.062222 - An MDA was carried out on the same training set as a benchmark.
0.096296 - Consequently, ANNs correctly classified 81.81% of the hold out sample correctly while MDA only attained 74.28%.
0.142717 - Tam and Kiang (1992) compared an ANN models’ performance with a linear discriminant model approach using the commercial bank failure data.
0.057348 - There were 59 failed and 59 non-failed banks which were considered for the period between 1985 and 1987.
0.171208 - Han, Jo, and Shin (1997) compared an ANN models’ performance with an MDA.
0.171958 - Among the models, ANN model had the highest level of accuracies (78.7%) in the given data sets.
0.083333 - Genetic algorithm (GA) is an innovative approach to artificial intelligence, capable of solving complex problems with almost no human supervision.
0.067901 - This algorithm utilizes the survival of the fittest to select the best solution for the problem under consideration (Davis, 1991; Goldberg, 1989; Holland, 1975).
0.095238 - An empirical application has been conducted by Varetto (1998), who introduces a GA to analyze the insolvency risk of 3840 industrial Italian companies.
0.043011 - Varetto compares linear discriminant analysis as a traditional statistical methodology for bankruptcy classification and prediction and a genetic algorithm.
0.058824 - He concludes that genetic algorithms are a very effective instrument for insolvency diagnosis, although the results obtained with linear discriminant analysis were superior to those obtained with the GA. Varetto notes that “the results of the GA were obtained in less time and with more limited contributions from the financial analyst than the linear dicriminant analysis.
0.114114 - Shin and Lee (2002) proposed a GA approach to bankruptcy prediction modeling, which is capable of extracting rules that are easy to understand for users.
0.062222 - They extracted five rules which predicted the bankrupt companies with 80.8% accuracy.
0.063492 - Kim and Han (2003) used GA for bankruptcy prediction.
0.076923 - The rules found through GA were superior to rules were found by neural networks.
0.158497 - Most of the bankruptcy studies in Iran conducted to ponder the capability of the widespread statistical methods for prediction bankruptcy of companies.
0.044444 - Most of these researches utilized multivariate statistical methods.
0.151144 - The first study (Rasoolzadeh, 2001) was conducted to answer if the Altman’s model is useful to predict the bankruptcy in Iran.
0.063492 - This study predicts bankrupt textile companies with 75% accuracy.
0.053333 - Financial information of textile companies during 1996–1999 was used in this study.
0.076348 - A recent study (Sohrabi Eraghi, 2008), using 21 ratios utilizing MDA with a total of all 460 listed companies, claim 80% accuracy to predict bankrupt companies.
0.082305 - Etemadi, Anvary Rostamy, and Farajzadeh Dehkordi (2009) developed a genetic programming model for bankruptcy prediction.
0.034188 - They report 94% accuracy in training set and 90% accuracy in their holdout set.
0.034722 - Their genetic programming was applied to classify 144 bankrupt and non-bankrupt Iranian firms listed in Tehran stock exchange (TSE).
0.095238 - Bostanian (2008) utilized GA in her study to classify Iranian companies into bankrupt and non bankrupt.
0.077295 - Her model attained only 92.5% and 91.5% accuracy rates.
0.070175 - The purpose of this article was twofold.
0.097778 - First, to conduct a new study for bankruptcy prediction studies of Iranian companies.
0.226496 - Second, to propose an artificial neural networks based model to predict bankruptcy of companies.
0.020202 - These dual purposes were a strong motivation for this research.
0.074074 - The overall organization of the paper is as follows.
0.080000 - After the introduction, fundamental issues of neural networks are presented in Section 2.

0.049383 - Finally, Section 8 concludes the paper.
0.050505 - An artificial neural network is similar to a human brain.
0.071111 - Likewise as the human brain, it contains of neurons and links between them.
0.122807 - A learning model is supervised, unsupervised or a mixture of the two, and replicates the process in which training data is offered to the neural network.
0.038314 - There are a number of different parameters that must be determined ahead when designing a neural network.
0.058824 - Among these parameters are the number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, the number of training iterations, and so on.
0.067183 - Some of the more important parameters in terms of training and network capacity are the number of hidden neurons, the learning rate and the momentum parameter (Nazzal, El-Emary, & Najim, 2008).
0.076628 - The multilayer perception (MLP) neural network is built up of simple components that will be described first.
0.042328 - A single-input neuron is shown in Fig 1.
0.048048 - The scalar weight w is multiplied by the scalar input p to form w ∗ p, which is sent to the adder for summing the inputs.
0.103785 - The other input, 1, is multiplied by a bias b and then passed to the adder.
0.038095 - The adder output y often called as the net input, goes into an activation function f which generates the scalar neuron output a.
0.086957 - Both w and b are adjustable scalar factors of the neuron.
0.054422 - Typically the transfer function is selected by the user and then the factors w and b will be customized by some learning rule in order that the neuron input or output relationship arrive at a challenging objective.
0.060185 - The transfer function in Fig 1 could be a linear or nonlinear function of n. A particular transfer function is chosen to go with some condition of the problem that the neuron is attempting to solve.
0.060606 - A particular transfer function is chosen to go with some condition of the problem that the neuron is attempting to solve.
0.057143 - One of the most commonly used functions is the log-sigmoid transfer function, which is shown in Fig 2 (Nazzal et al., 2008).
0.000000 - Single input neuron Fig 1.
0.000000 - Single input neuron.
0.000000 - Log-sigmoid transfer function Fig 2.
0.000000 - Log-sigmoid transfer function.
0.069444 - In multi-layer networks that are trained using the back propagation algorithm the log-sigmoid transfer function is usually used.
0.038647 - Frequently one neuron, even with many inputs, may not be sufficient.
0.040404 - More than one neuron working in parallel might be required.
0.024691 - This will be called a “layer”.
0.000000 - A neuron usually has more than one input.
0.080808 - Now consider a network with two layers which has been used in this paper for the purpose of analyzing bankruptcy prediction.
0.035088 - In this network each layer has its own weight matrix w, its own bias vector b, a net input vector n and an output vector a.
0.060606 - A typical two layer network is shown in Fig 3.
0.045752 - Mathematical presentation of this network is as follows: (1) y is final output and S is transfer function related to each layer.
0.059259 - Vectors bi and wi are network factors, bias and input weights, respectively in ith layer of neural network.
0.057613 - Dimension of these vectors in each layer show the number of neurons of the layer.
0.023392 - A sample two layer network Fig 3.
0.026144 - A sample two layer network.
0.072222 - The property that is of primary significance for neural network is the ability of the network to learn from its environment and to improve its performance through learning.
0.090909 - The learning process corresponds to the estimation process in statistics.
0.066852 - In the supervised learning tasks, a set of input–output vectors are presented to the network, a learning algorithm adjusts the connection weights until the output vector of the network approximates the target vector as closely as possible.
0.063492 - In order to do this, an error function is defined, such as sum-of-squares error.
0.069717 - While sum-of-squares error is the most commonly used error function in MLP applications, there are many other choices which are well-founded, depending on the nature of the training data and the target output of the network.
0.079894 - Many learning algorithm are use in neural networks which are included of conjugate gradient learning (Zhang, 2000), Levenberg–Marquardt learning process (Singh, Gupta, & Gupta, 2007), and Bayesian learning (Zhang, 2009).
0.023810 - GAs are statistical search methods that can search large and complex spaces based on natural genetics.
0.041152 - GAs conducts an investigation procedure in four stages: initialization, selection, crossover, and mutation (Davis, 1991).
0.066667 - In the initialization stage, a population of chromosomes with genetic structures, are randomly scattered in the solution space.
0.019324 - Then each chromosome is evaluating by a user defined fitness function.
0.088889 - The fitness function’s job is to train the performance of the chromosome.
0.071111 - Deciding on the fitness function is the most important step in real applications.
0.086022 - From the initial population of chromosomes, a new population is generated using three genetic operators: reproduction, crossover, and mutation.
0.081871 - These are modeled on their biological equivalents.
0.087302 - Members of the population are chosen for the new population by probabilities proportional to their fitness.
0.076190 - Pairs of chromosomes in the new population are selected at random to exchange genetic material, their bits, in a mating operation called crossover.
0.063492 - This produces two new chromosomes that replace the parents.
0.070707 - Randomly chosen bits in the offspring are flipped, called mutation.
0.057971 - The new population generated with these operators replaces the old population.
0.060606 - The population develops, containing more and more very fit chromosomes.
0.050505 - When the convergence criterion is reached, such as no significant further increase in the average fitness of the population, the best chromosome produced is decoded into the search space point it represents.
0.038095 - Multiple discriminant analysis is a multivariate statistical method, used for classification of observations based on two or more independent variables (Johnson & Wichern, 2002).
0.030303 - This method determines that to which group, an observation belongs.
0.054201 - MDA stands on the maximum likelihood of correct classification and constructs some linear combinations of independent variables, called discriminant functions or classification functions, to separate observations into predetermined groups.
0.044444 - A discriminant function is like Eq (2): (2) where Z is the discriminant score, Wi is the discriminant weight for variable i and Xi is the variable i.
0.076190 - The discriminant function is built in such a way to maximize the ratio between groups sum of squares/within groups sum of squares.
0.068966 - It is built in a way that first discriminant function is calculated to best separate the groups.
0.055556 - The second discriminant function is calculated to best separate the groups and is not correlated to the first one and so on, to reach the maximum number of discriminant functions: min (number of groups – 1, p).
0.031746 - Principal component analysis is a multivariate statistical method used for reduction of dataset dimension (Jolliffe, 2002).
0.057971 - Reduction of dataset dimension has some advantages like that with low dimension, interpretation of data is easier and also the behavior of data can be seen graphically in the space of most important components.
0.046296 - Important components are those that express and contain more variance of dataset.
0.030864 - Although for definition of a problem p variables are required, but frequently most of these variables can be shown with k components (k < p).
0.068966 - So almost the same amounts of information are in the reduced components as in the original variables.
0.078078 - With this operation, the problem dimension of p × n will be reduced to k × n, where k < p and n is the number of observations.
0.030651 - Principal components are specific linear combinations of original variables calculated on variance-covariance matrix of original variables.
0.044444 - Principal components are rated according to their importance.
0.057971 - The first principal component is the one whose variance is maximum.
0.048048 - The second principal component is the one whose variance is the next maximum and it is not correlated with first principal component and so on.
0.101010 - The principal components are extracted in decreasing order of importance.
0.078431 - The principal components whose cumulative variance is not high can be eliminated and in this way data dimension reduction will be achieved.
0.143864 - Constructing a model to classify a population is based on many parameters which are independent of the implied model.
0.074074 - In this section selecting the population will be discussed.
0.111640 - The main goal of this research is using financial ratios to predict financial health of listed Iranian companies.
0.095623 - At first the ratios introduced by predecessor gathered and then with experts’ guidelines the ratios using for constructing the models have been selected.
0.078114 - This study by no means claims that the best ratios have been selected for discrimination of bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies except its goal is to find the ratios that have the potential of sending relevance signal related to future financial status of the companies.
0.080610 - Population and sample Population under this study is the accepted manufacturing companies in Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) for one year ended March 21, 2008.
0.085470 - The reason for this choice is the availability of financial information of these companies.
0.063492 - There are 461 companies listed in TSE in 37 industry groups which 412 of them are manufacturing companies and 49 are non-manufacturing.
0.080247 - The number the manufacturing companies are more than other listed companies and they are subject to grant more loans due to their extensive activities.
0.050505 - A sample of 180 companies is chosen for this research.
0.076628 - In Tehran stock exchange, the measure for companies exiting capital market is commercial law of 141 act.
0.069444 - According to this act the companies are known as bankrupt whose retained losses are more than 50% of their capital.
0.046784 - 58 companies are bankrupt under this law.
0.111823 - The rest of non-bankrupt companies have been randomly selected from the remaining list.
0.052696 - Financial ratios for 180 manufacturing companies quoted in Tehran Stock Exchange for one year (year ended March 21, 2008) have been used.
0.115510 - The required data to calculate the ratios have been gathered from companies’ balance sheets and income statements.
0.123457 - Variables selection The first step in designing a classification model is the selection of variables.
0.111111 - Selecting the right variables has a critical rule in building a model.
0.044444 - Noticing few points in selecting variables are important.
0.042328 - First of all, number of variables should be appropriate.
0.026144 - Second, it can be calculated.
0.093684 - Dependent variable for classification of companies to two distinct bankrupt and non bankrupt companies is the trade act 141.
0.038095 - As it mentioned before according to this act a company is bankrupt if its retained losses is more than 50% of its capital.
0.086957 - In most bankruptcy studies a set of initial variables were used.
0.034188 - This set had been chosen arbitrary or they were selected based on previous study.
0.055556 - The arbitrary selection methods are used since there was no fundamental theory to help researcher to select the correct ratios.
0.055556 - The second type, based on previous study, was not without mistakes either.
0.053872 - Since these common used ratios are exposed to false presentation and might be reported incorrectly by companies’ it selves (Beaver, 1966).
0.057143 - In this research set of independent variables including 17 ratios were selected based on previous study and were finalized after interview with experts.
0.087542 - In this regard, the author tried her best to choose the ratios that were matched with financial condition of Iranian companies.
0.123457 - Since many used ratios in other study outside the atmosphere of Iran could not be an appropriate financial health prediction symbol for Iranian companies.
0.019324 - Ratios based on cash flows are among those (Sohrabi Eraghi, 2008).
0.084656 - Table 1 show the ratios utilized in this research.
0.048309 - Detail definition of these ratios is fully explained in Peterson (1999).
0.000000 - Table 1.
0.023392 - Ratios used to build initial variables set.
0.004938 - Ratio Number Working capital/total assets X1 Operating income/total assets X2 Market value/total assets X3 Sales/total assets X4 Owners’ equity/total assets X5 Net income/total assets X6 current ratio X7 Quick ratio X8 Gross profit/sales X9 Sales/inventory X10 Sales/fixed assets X11 Net income/sales X12 Sales/total liabilities X13 Net income/owners’ equity X14 Account receivables/average daily sales X15 Operating income/interest expenses X16 Cost of goods sold/inventory X17
0.098148 - Classification based on neural network Binary classification (Min & Jeong, 2009) is a method of classifying the members of a given set of objects into two groups to find a model to predict the classification of any new entry.
0.086420 - It is a two stages process: Learning: In this stage a classification model based on analysis or learning from training date set is built.
0.088889 - In other words with any input vector X = (x1, x2, … , xn) and label of the class which the vector belongs to, the model start to learning any relationships between it and corresponding class.
0.125926 - Classification: In this stage utilizing the built model in previous stage it starts to classify of new data.
0.068553 - Classification is a crucial step for analyzing financial status of companies.
0.046784 - Bankruptcy prediction belongs to binary classification problem.
0.072683 - The effective factors to financial health of companies are financial ratios which are considered as input vector X = x1, x2, … , xn in such a way that xi, i ∊ [1, n] is the ith factor.
0.062802 - The goal is to find label of occurrence of bankruptcy for any input vector X so that for y equal 1 the label shows non-bankrupt and for y equal 0 it says bankrupt.
0.121789 - A few numbers of learning algorithms such as of the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm and conjugate gradient, and Bayesian learning algorithms have been proposed.
0.018519 - Data pre-processing Data pre-processing is a useful step before classification.
0.045977 - In general pre-processing includes three stages; data transformation, data cleaning, and data selection (Han & Kamber, 2001).
0.048309 - Data transformation addresses to delete the inconsistent data from training set.
0.033333 - A common approach of transformation is normalizing data.
0.041152 - Normalizing is to re-write all factors in a known range for example [0, 1].
0.051282 - Normalization prevents elimination of the effect of small inputs by effects of large inputs.
0.044444 - There are two main normalizing methods; linear and stochastic (Nguyen and Chan, 2004).
0.014337 - (1) Linear normalization into [a, b] range that is done with following Eq (3): (3) (2) Stochastic normalization or .
0.083333 - In this equation x and σ are the mean and standard deviation, respectively.
0.087977 - In this study both methods have been used and the first method, linear normalization showed higher precision and has been selected.
0.047619 - Also the log-sigmoid transfer function (Nazzal et al., 2008), is selected among the transfer functions.
0.061728 - It takes the input (which may have any value between plus and minus infinity) and squashes the output into the range 0 to 1.
0.088889 - It is appropriate to say that since the outputs of classification models generally are in this range 0 to 1 but they are not necessarily equal to 0 and 1, utilizing a tolerance limit for classification is required.
0.067633 - After many tests a tolerance limit of 0.65 is found.
0.059259 - Selection of validation set When the training set in each class are large, neural network instead of learning of the relationship between variables tries to retain the output amount for corresponding input variables.
0.085470 - This phenomenon reduces the generalization in test stage and result a high classification error.
0.086999 - For this reason a part of data set is considered as validation set and with tracing the network learning, the power of generalization in validation set have been evaluated.
0.061303 - When the network learning becomes better but the generalization of network gets weaker, the learning must stop.
0.074074 - In this spot the overfitting in network is happening.
0.085641 - For this reason many tests with different combination of sizes for training set, validation set, and test set have been accomplished and at last the best combination which reached the minimum model error was selected (Wang, Yang, Shi, & Wang, 2008).
0.047619 - This combination assign 80% to training set, 15% to test set, and 5% to validation set.
0.111111 - Structure of classification model The neural network structure is used for classification.
0.060060 - The neural networks are able to estimate any complex and non-linear relations between input and output vectors in short time and with high accuracy.
0.111111 - The inputs for current classification model are financial ratios as discussed in preceding parts.
0.050505 - Structure of employed network can be seen in Table 2.
