0.098958 - The sampling time of the records is approximately one hour.

0.148148 - It is used to derive the clinical knowledge in the control setting of the ventilator.
0.105534 - Hebbian ordering based rule reduction neuro-fuzzy system In fuzzy system, the crisp inputs are firstly fuzzified into fuzzy inputs and subsequently transformed into fuzzy outputs through a set of fuzzy rules, which has the form of Mamdani type as described in Eq (1).
0.076218 - The output of the fuzzy system is defuzzified into crisp output for the real-world application: (1) where x1 and x2 are input linguistic variables; y1 is output linguistic variable; A, B and C are linguistic labels for variables x1, x2 and y1 respectively.
0.117117 - A five-layer neural network is used to integrate with the fuzzy rule system.
0.094801 - This allows the neural learning capabilities to derive parameters for the fuzzy linguistic label and fuzzy rules that best describe the fuzzy relationship present in the observed data.
0.075881 - The neural network structure is shown in Fig 1.
0.074392 - It consists of the input layer (which performs the fuzzification), condition layer, rule node layer (each node denotes a fuzzy rule), consequence layer and the output layer (which performs the defuzzification).

0.054264 - The centroids and widths of the membership functions are denoted as (the ith input dimension and the jth MF) for the input layer and (the mth output dimension and the lth MF) for the output layer.
0.049383 - By denoting ILk(i) as the input label in the ith input dimension of the kth rule, and OLk(m) as the output label in the mth output dimension of the kth rule, the final output of the mth output dimension, denoted as , can be expressed as follows: (2) where is called the firing strength of the input point XT.
0.105049 - The structure of 5-layer neuro-fuzzy system Fig 1.
0.114041 - The structure of 5-layer neuro-fuzzy system.
0.109087 - There are two important issues in neuro-fuzzy modeling, namely: the interpretability and accuracy.
0.084978 - Interpretability refers to the capability of the fuzzy model to express the behavior of the system in an understandable way, while the accuracy refers to the capability of the fuzzy model to faithfully represent the system (Casillas, Cordon, Herrera, & Magdalena, 2003).
0.069837 - Interpretability and accuracy are usually pursued for contradictory purposes and sometimes are dipoles apart as the system complexity increases.
0.074303 - When tuning the membership functions of the rules to diminish the modeling error, the interpretability of the rules may be degraded during the tuning process, where the fuzzy sets can drift closer to each other and may end up overlapping each others (Setnes, Babuska, Kaymak, & van Nauta Lemke, 1998).
0.099000 - Thus, a balance between interpretability and accuracy is desirable.
0.096887 - This is achieved by using a 3 phase intuitive Hebbian processes as follows (see Fig 2): the initial rule generation (P1), the iterative rule reduction and refinement (P2), and the membership function tuning (P3).
0.126126 - The flow chart of the proposed rule generation, reduction and tuning process Fig 2.
0.135266 - The flow chart of the proposed rule generation, reduction and tuning process.
0.103604 - In P1 phase, the fuzzy rules are formulated to cover all the training samples.
0.118397 - The number of input labels, as well as the output labels in the neuro-fuzzy model, is equal to the number of the fuzzy rules.
0.080201 - This causes an excessive number of adjustable parameters in the system.
0.078125 - Also, the resultant fuzzy sets have large areas of overlapping.
0.011799 - These will be reduced in P2 phase.
0.093580 - In P2 phase, an iterative tuning process is employed.
0.080454 - It consists of two sub-phases: rule reduction (P2.1) and membership function refinement (P2.2).
0.119850 - The objective of this phase is to improve the interpretability of the model and simultaneously to maintain high modeling accuracy.
0.095745 - Membership functions are merged according to the degree of their overlap, and redundant and conflicting rules are deleted at the same time.
0.185085 - A merging scheme based on the Hebbian ordering of rules is proposed.
0.054363 - There are 3 procedures in P2.1 phase: rank the rules (P2.1.1), merge the membership functions (P2.1.2), and reduce the redundant and conflictive rules (P2.1.3).
0.138612 - The system first ranks all the rules according to the importance of each rule, which is realized by the Hebbian ordering in the proposed method.
0.091285 - Then the membership functions of each variable are merged in accordance to a set of criteria, which will be defined later.
0.078652 - Finally, if there are any equivalent rules that have the same condition and consequence, only one of them is preserved.
0.051002 - If there are any conflicting rules that have the same condition but different consequence, the ones with lower importance are removed.
0.046414 - If there is only one MF of an input feature variable, this feature will be reduced.
0.093897 - In P2.2 phase, the Least Mean Square (LMS) algorithm is employed to tune the centers and widths of the membership functions to reduce the modeling error.
0.078818 - As there may be unsatisfied overlaps between membership functions, there will be iteration in P2.1 phase to reduce the membership functions and the rules.
0.103441 - The stopping criterion for iteration is as follows: Denote the training error after the ith time of rule reduction (P2.1) and MF refinement (P2.2) as .
0.077441 - If i exceeds the maximum iteration imax, or , then restore the rule set just after the ith iteration and goes to the next phase.
0.135643 - η is a human defined parameter that controls the number of rule reduction.
0.101976 - This is based on the fact that if the number of rule is less than necessary, the training error will become much larger than before.
0.126789 - P3 phase is the fine tuning of the membership functions to achieve a high level of accuracy.
0.087146 - In this phase, there will be no further reduction of the membership functions and rules.
0.057803 - This phase has a larger number of updating epochs due to smaller learning rate than that of P2 phase.
0.066047 - Initial rule base formulation During the rule initialization phase, whenever a new data sample is presented, if there are no rules in the rule base, or if the strength of the rule with the largest firing strength is below a specified threshold θ, a new rule node will be created.
0.096339 - This threshold controls the coverage of the data space by the rules and affects the number of initial rules.
0.069717 - The larger the threshold, the fewer the rules that will be generated, and vice versa.
0.085386 - When a new rule node is created, for each pair of input and output dimensions, a neuron is inserted into the condition and consequence layers.
0.092335 - The centroid of the newly generated membership functions is set to the data sample, while the width of the membership functions is set to a predefined value in proportion to the scale of each dimension.
0.073446 - Fig 3 shows the flowchart of this phase.
0.079096 - Flowchart of the rule initialization algorithm Fig 3.
0.086420 - Flowchart of the rule initialization algorithm.
0.098187 - Hebbian-based membership function and rule reduction Excessive membership functions and rules are generated during the rule initialization phase and they should be reduced so as to provide a clearer and concise linguistic semantic meaning of each fuzzy set and subsequently decreases the complexity of the model.
0.108932 - In fuzzy modeling, each fuzzy rule corresponds to a sub-region of the decision space.
0.072456 - Some rules lying in a proper region may represent many samples and have much influence on the final result, while some other rules may occasionally be generated by noise and become redundant in the rule base.
0.126575 - Thus, the importance of each rule is not necessarily of the same value.
0.135054 - This section introduces the Hebbian importance of fuzzy rules and explains how it is utilized to merge the fuzzy sets.
0.113674 - As the membership functions of a rule are determined, the training sample is fed into both the input and output layers simultaneously.
0.088698 - The input is used to produce the firing strength of the kth rule node, while is fed into the consequence layer to derive the membership values at the output label nodes.
0.054492 - As stated in the Hebbian learning algorithm (Hebb, 1949): “When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite a cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes place in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A’s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased”, so if the input–output samples repeatedly fire a rule by the product of their firing strength and the membership values, and the accumulated strength surpasses that of other rules, it indicates the existence of such a rule.
0.076503 - In another view, the accumulated strength exerted by the sample pairs reflects the degree of coverage of them by the rule.
0.107394 - The rule that covers the samples to a higher degree will have greater influence on the modeling accuracy.
0.091873 - This is due to the fact that when the membership functions of the rule or the rule itself are merged or deleted respectively, it will result in a larger change in the fuzzy inference results and significantly affect the modeling accuracy.
0.090395 - Thus such a rule is of greater importance.
0.091229 - To derive a good balance between interpretability and accuracy, when membership functions and rules are reduced, it is desirable to preserve all such efficient and effective rules.
0.057471 - Let’s define the degree of the coverage of the ith data point by the kth rule as in Eq (3): (3) where Ck,i is the degree of the coverage of the ith data point by the kth rule, is the kth rule firing strength and is the product of the membership functions.
0.077636 - The Hebbian importance of the kth rule is defined as the sum of the degree of coverage of all the training samples as in Eq (4): (4) The fuzzy rules can then be efficiently sorted by the importance of them, defined by Eq (4), in a decreasing order.
0.163561 - This is called the Hebbian ordering of the rules.
0.079658 - At the beginning of rule reduction, the original rule set, denoted by R, contains all the sorted rules and the reduced rule set, denoted by R′, contains nothing.
0.106658 - The rules in R are presented successively according to their Hebbian orders.
0.073375 - If there is no rule in the reduced rule set, the rule in R is directly added into R′, otherwise, the fuzzy set in each dimension of the rule will be added or merged into the fuzzy sets in R′ according to a set of criteria defined below.
0.084778 - All the newly added or merged fuzzy sets will be linked together to formulate a new rule in R′.
0.060606 - During the merging process, some fuzzy sets may be shared by several rules.
0.075949 - To change a fuzzy set shared by many rules is equivalent to modifying these rules simultaneously.
0.073070 - This may exert much influence on the overall system performance, as a less shared fuzzy set only affects the performance locally.
0.076577 - Thus, much shared fuzzy set is of higher importance than the less shared ones.
0.097561 - Denote the importance of a fuzzy set F as .
0.067901 - is changing during the merging process.
0.085106 - At each time the kth rule in the original rule set R is presented, its fuzzy sets Ai and Bj (i.e.
0.043651 - for the kth rule “IF xi = Ai THEN yj = Bj”) are as important as their rule, i.e.
0.021680 - (5) for i = 1, … , n1 and j = 1, … , n5.
0.067146 - For each input dimension i, among the fuzzy sets in the reduced rule set R′ of this dimension, the fuzzy set with the maximum degree of overlap over Ai (the degree of overlap is defined in Eq (9)) is selected.
0.072581 - If the maximum degree of overlap satisfies a specified criteria, they will be merged into another fuzzy set , otherwise, the fuzzy set Ai is directly added into the reduced rule set of this dimension.
0.098958 - The centroid and the variance of Ai and , i.e.
0.024691 - and , are merged into using Eqs.
0.014337 - (6) and (7).
0.071542 - (6) (7) The importance of the new fuzzy set is given by Eq (8): (8) In other words, the centroid and variance of resultant fuzzy set is the weighted average of the two fuzzy sets in accordance to their importance, and the degree of importance of this final fuzzy set is the sum of the importance of the two.
0.060150 - Then the newly generated fuzzy set replaces the previous fuzzy set .
0.086134 - For each output dimension, fuzzy set Bj is either added directly or merged into the fuzzy sets of this output dimension in the reduced rule set, using the same process for the input dimensions.
0.083333 - Finally, the newly added or merged fuzzy sets in all the dimensions are linked together to formulate a fuzzy rule in the reduced rule set R′.
0.075830 - Given fuzzy sets A and B, the degree of overlap of A by B is defined in Eq (9): (9) As the Gaussian membership function is used in the proposed method, the overlap measure can be derived using the centers and variances of the membership functions.
0.056338 - For the fuzzy sets A and B, with membership functions and respectively, assuming that cA ⩾ cB and then |A| and |A∩B| can be expressed in Eqs.
0.009009 - (10) and (11) (Juang & Lin, 1998): (10) (11) where h(x) = max {0, x}.
0.108136 - Let be a threshold that determines the maximum degree of overlap between fuzzy sets that the system can tolerate.
0.052083 - The merging criterion is: if or , they will be merged.
0.087912 - Higher increases the accuracy but would degrade the interpretability, while a lower causes larger number of rules to be reduced but the risk is that the number of rules may be less than necessary to maintain high modeling accuracy.
0.063604 - After all the rules are presented, the following steps are executed to remove feature and delete redundant and conflicting rules in the reduced rule set R′: S1: If there is only one membership function within one dimension, this dimension (i.e.
0.054054 - feature) will be removed S2: If there is any rule that has the same conditions and consequences with others, it is removed S3: If there are any conflicting rules that have equivalent conditions but different consequences, the one with the higher degree of importance is preserved and the others are deleted.
0.088652 - Finally, the original rule set is replaced with the reduced rule set The detail of the algorithm is shown in Fig 4.

0.112168 - In both studies, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the advised value of FiO2 by neuro-fuzzy hybrid systems and the setting of the clinician, is used to assess the performance.
0.050940 - Some other well-established neuro-fuzzy systems are employed for benchmarking.
