The study use ANN, decision trees and the hybrid model of ANN and decision trees, to forecast stock prices. By using digital game content stocks in Taiwan as the sample. ANN is a more stable method for predicting stock prices in the volatile post-crisis stock market.

0.165877 - Precise prediction of stock prices is difficult chiefly because of the many intervening factors.
0.145204 - Unpredictability is particularly notable in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
0.040161 - Data mining may however be used to discover highly correlated estimation models.
0.298118 - This study looks at artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees and the hybrid model of ANN and decision trees (hybrid model), the three common algorithm methods used for numerical analysis, to forecast stock prices.
0.149953 - The author compared the stock price forecasting models derived from the three methods, and applied the models on 10 different stocks in 320 data sets in an empirical forecast.
0.176520 - Average accuracy of ANN is 15.31%, the highest, in terms of match with real market stock prices, followed by decision trees, at 14.06%; hybrid model is 13.75%.
0.365720 - The study also discovers that compared to the other two methods, ANN is a more stable method for predicting stock prices in the volatile post-crisis stock market.
0.115501 - Since mid-2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to global economic repercussions, the stock market has been hard hit.
0.065728 - Stock indices fell, and economies went into recession.
0.098246 - More than one year later, stock indices have witnessed sharp fluctuations, especially in new emerging markets.
0.126246 - In addition, globalization has made forecasting of stock prices increasingly difficult (Albuquerque, Francisco, & Marques, 2008; Stock & Watson, 2007).
0.120304 - However, we need to know if the study samples of this period and the results of the forecasts of previous researchers are in line with our expectations.
0.153064 - In addition, among Asian emerging markets, China’s economic growth has been the engine spurring on the development of stock markets in the region; hence the greater volatility of stock prices in these markets.
0.070905 - Thus, we need to attach greater importance to emerging stock markets (Dutta, Jha, Laha, & Mohan, 2006; Fidrmuc & Korhonen, 2009).
0.087714 - The Taiwan stock market, which has close inter-connection with Mainland China, is another example worth observing (Lai, Fan, Huang, & Chang, 2009; Lin & Yeh, 2009).
0.191574 - Many algorithm methods are used to predict stock prices.
0.045375 - Examples are the artificial neural networks (ANN) (Desai & Bharati, 2007; Kim & Shin, 2007; Pino, Parreno, Gomez, & Priore, 2008; Zhu, Wang, Xu, & Li, 2008), Fuzzy (Khashei, Hejazi, & Bijari, 2008; Lee & Kim, 2007), or other statistical or forecasting methods (Chen, Gou, Guo, & Gao, 2008; Hu & He, 2007; Ince & Trafalis, 2008).
0.157996 - All these methods attempt to predict stock prices under different market and economic conditions, and of them, ANN has produced rather good outcomes and has been the favourite method for many.
0.037559 - Ou and Wang (2009), and Lai et al.
0.219394 - (2009) believe that the decision tree (DT) method is good for forecasting stock prices.
0.056140 - Levin and Zahavi (2001) found that problem-correlation using DT is much clearer than traditional methods.
0.108903 - In fact, DT is a very good forecasting method.
0.112450 - The Bayes’ Theorem may be used as a basis for scientific forecasts.
0.014981 - However, DT studies have focused on commercial activities (Aitkenhead, 2008; Reyck, Degraeve, & Vandenborre, 2008).
0.172281 - In recent years, there has been a lack of research in the prediction of stock prices using both DT and ANN, and comparing the results of one method against the other.
0.116263 - Most ANN studies have focused on its evolution and improvement (Ihme, Marsden, & Pitsch, 2008; Lin & Yeh, 2009; Paliwal & Kumar, 2009), and integrated fuzzy models on the forecasting of stock prices (Khashei et al., 2008; Lai et al., 2009).
0.099010 - This study aims to fill the research gap by adopting a broader approach through in-depth empirical studies.
0.302869 - The study adopts a hybrid model, using ANN and DT as the foundation, to forecast stock prices.
0.154631 - Try to find out if this model produces better forecasts of stock prices, compared to the earlier two methods.
0.178108 - Hence, the results of forecasted stock prices using the three abovementioned methods (ANN, DT and hybrid model) are compared against each other to find out the differences.
0.115152 - In doing so, we can see if the results of our forecasts match our expectations, and discover the most stable model.
0.108333 - Taiwan began promoting the digital content industry around the year 2000.
0.079380 - Taiwan consumers were receptive to digital games.
0.034632 - In addition some companies were early investors in Mainland China.
0.154631 - The absence of a language barrier allowed them to have higher overseas revenue; hence, good performance in stock prices.
0.125194 - However, no stock price index is available for reference for this stock cluster.
0.065728 - Instead, they are classified as “information software stocks”.
0.132811 - A stock price index comprises prices of stocks of companies in similar businesses; hence, price movements of stocks tend to affect one another.
0.152214 - And investors can determine fluctuations against each other of stock prices of companies in relevant clusters from the key constituent indices.
0.101602 - However, an industry stock index may not be available for some industries, especially in emerging stock markets, because of their lack of maturity, and few listings.
0.125512 - As a result, investors’ can rely only on subjective norms and personal perception, and are unable to achieve better forecasting of stock prices (Hong, Torous, & Valkanov, 2007).
0.151120 - Hence, to have a better grasp of digital game content stocks in Taiwan, we need to observe the business composition of a company, and based on prior expert consultations, determine if a company is indeed in the business of digital game content.
0.194649 - There is no precise definition for the term “digital game content stocks”.
0.191369 - But the term “digital game stocks” defined in the Taiwan stock market basically includes manufacturing of games spare parts and components, and online games.
0.090689 - Manufacturing of games spare parts and components does not derive its main income from “game content”; instead, income is generated mainly from the production of parts and components of console games.
0.044944 - Examples of OEM manufacturers of console games are PixArt Imaging, Delta Group, and Genius.
0.118750 - However, digital game stocks of this nature that are mainly stocks of OEM manufacturers are not included in this study.
0.083467 - On the other hand, as summer vacation approaches every year, most investors would think of digital content game stocks along the lines of online games, PC games or arcade games, most of which are either information software or actually contain designed game content.
0.148450 - These are the digital game content companies whose stocks will be studied herein.
0.234884 - The study uses the data mining method to derive actual forecasted stock prices.
0.092409 - Data mining is concerned with the development and applications of algorithms for discovery of a priori unknown relationships.
0.073216 - Han and Kamber (2006, p. 7) defines data mining as ‘‘the process of discovering interesting knowledge from large amounts of data stored in databases, data warehouses, or other information repositories”.
0.083832 - Berry and Linoff (1997) point out that data mining is the exploration and analysis, by automatic or semi-automatic means, of large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns and rules, and to establish effective models and rules.
0.106195 - Data mining is currently widely used in many applications, as users attempt to discover patterns or predict the future using historical data.
0.151865 - The data mining methods used in this study are mainly ANN and DT in order to derive the most relevant results.
0.166184 - As for the hybrid model, it is developed by integrating the results from ANN and DT analyses, to deduce a new model.
0.094186 - Artificial neural networks Artificial neural networks, or ANN, is a popular prediction tool.
0.098015 - It is a technique that simulates the learning process of biological neural networks, by developing models from extremely complex and non-linear formulae.
0.092826 - By using different variables and assumed parameters, it trains a neural network to perform better analysis and predictions.
0.199783 - ANN has been fruitful in predicting stock prices.
0.117011 - Antonio, Claudio, Manuel, and Nelson (1996) was 63.3% accurate in their prediction of the range of rises of San Diego’s stock market, and 74.7% accurate in falls.
0.136024 - When Steiner and Wittkemper (1997) predicted the European stock market between 1991 and 1997, the accuracy of their predictions was generally efficient.
0.114943 - When Shachmurove and Witkowska (2000) compared results using the Ordinary Least Squares method (OLS) and ANN, they found ANN a better prediction tool.
0.000000 - Dutta et al.
0.143284 - (2006) predicted the Indian stock market with ANN, and found that the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are in line with the expected smallness of error.
0.000000 - Zhu et al.
0.132013 - (2008) forecasted the NASDAQ, DJIA and STI indices, and found the ANN model to have good prediction performance.
0.197268 - Based on previous papers written, there have been good researches and recommendations on the use of ANN as a prediction method for stock prices.
0.115646 - Among the ANN learning models, the back-propagation neural network (BPN) is most popular and widely used.
0.047619 - Most users of BPN would have to carry out multiple tests to arrive at a better model.
0.077519 - Hence, there are many methods that help optimize the network and determine parameters.
0.105919 - Multiple, Prune and K-means are highly accurate methods with fast responses, and are often used to train the ANN.
0.203295 - Thus, this study will use BPN as a prediction model of stock prices.
0.145528 - Decision tree Modeled after the structure of a tree, DTs are able to provide a good explanation applicable to the prediction of stock prices, and interpret problems very much according to the principles of mathematical and statistical principles (Brida & Risso, 2010).
0.106328 - DT is a fairly mature technique which includes models such as C5.0, C&RT, CHAID, QUEST and ID3, the difference of which is in the derivations of formula, such as entropy and information gain, to determine the attributes that result in splitting.
0.039513 - However, most decision trees consist of many nodes, which, under certain circumstances, hinder analysis or interpretation of information (Aitkenhead, 2008; Ture, Tokatli, & Kurt, 2009).
0.115501 - The classification and regression trees (CART or C&RT) method of Breiman, Friedman, Olshen, and Stone (1984) generates binary decision trees.
0.092680 - In the real world, the chances of biased binary outcomes are few, but the binary method allows for easy interpretation and analysis (Ture et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2003).
0.213713 - Thus, the study uses the binary method in the DT prediction of stock prices, and attempts to deduce a correlated prediction factor.
0.331143 - Data collection and methods By using digital game content stocks in Taiwan as the sample.
0.125267 - In terms of the choice of digital game stocks, the key words “game stock” were keyed into the UDNDATA online database to search for information between 1 January 2008 and 31 May 2009, and game stocks as described in the database were extracted.
0.072727 - Through pre-testing, we interviewed managers of securities companies and investors who traded more than US$50,000 in May 2009.
0.097378 - Hence, every game stock was verified by a total of 30 experts and investors.
0.142857 - We then compiled and screened the results, and selected 10 game stocks as shown in Table 1.
0.000000 - Table 1.
0.125573 - Digital content stock corporation.
0.089457 - Stock ID Name of corporation (3064) Astro (3083) Chinesegamer (3086) Wayi (3293) International Games System (IGS) (3546) UserJoy (4415) Mega Biotech & Electronics (5478) Soft-World (6111) SoftStar (6169) Interserv (6180) Gamania The 10 game stocks are traded in the OTC Exchange of Taiwan, and have fairly similar IPO backgrounds.
0.144042 - Daily closing stock prices of each of the 10 stocks were gathered from the Gre Tai Securities Market (GTSM) database.
0.114839 - Key information collected includes: daily closing OTC index and the daily closing prices of each stock for the period between 1 July 2008 and 31 June 2009.
0.039216 - A total of 5229 records were extracted.
0.118812 - The unit cluster for all data (for each stock and OTC index) is based on the trading date.
0.018018 - Finally, 249 cases were selected as our data set.
0.078788 - Symbol description To better describe the results of our data analysis, mathematical symbols and alphabetical representations are used for simplification purposes.
0.112450 - The symbols represent the following descriptions: (Stockid): Stock code, a numerical value.
0.078431 - For example, 3064 represents the company Astro.
0.108108 - S (stockid): Current day closing price of a stock.
0.119909 - The opening price of a stock cannot be used as the benchmark for inputting or analysis, as it does not represent its previous day’s closing price due to uncertainties during the period when the market is closed for trading.
0.066158 - At the same time, comparing the day’s closing price with the previous day’s closing price provides an indication of the magnitude of any rise or fall.
0.140116 - Hence, the daily closing price is used as the parameter for our analysis.
0.119309 - In addition, when collecting information on stock prices, the day’s closing price is treated as the same closing price of the previous day if no real transaction is concluded on that day.
0.089888 - As such, the previous day’s closing price is indicated as Sday−1(stockid).
0.000000 - O: OTC index.
0.076923 - Refers to the current day closing OTC index; OTC index of the previous day is represented by Oday−1.
0.117912 - P(stockid): Current day’s predicted stock closing price.
0.119636 - PER Prediction error ratio, the absolute value of the sum of the current day’s predicted stock closing price divided by the current day’s closing price minus 1.
0.078654 - A smaller ratio indicates a more accurate and better prediction.
0.034632 - Its mathematical formula is shown as follows: (1) 4.3.
0.051675 - Experimental procedure Data mining is carried out via SPSS Clementine11.1, where ANN and C&RT analyses are performed.
0.077922 - SPSS15.0 is then used to develop a regression model.
0.107204 - Prediction analysis is based on three methods, the procedures of each is described as follows: (i) Artificial neural networks: ANN is a type of artificial intelligence.
0.032129 - We used a standard three-layer fully connected back-propagation neural network.
0.115501 - Input layer nodes represent the previous day’s stock closing prices and the previous day’s OTC closing index (Oday−1).
0.116667 - Output layer nodes represent the current day’s stock closing prices.
0.153160 - Supervised learning is used to train the back-propagation neural network, and current day’s actual stock prices to correct the model to arrive at a better prediction.
0.092457 - The pruning method is used to train, assuming that hidden layer 1 is 12, in line with the selection criteria for the basic hidden layer (input layer + output layer)/2).
0.097181 - As training progresses, the worst units in the hidden layers and input layer will be pruned, and the final outcome generated will be better than other training methods.
0.096386 - The stopping rule is triggered by selecting the best training mode (default).
0.080000 - After ANN analysis, we observed if the estimated accuracy value is greater than 90%; if so, we repeated our observation of the relative importance of inputs.
0.111916 - As the higher the value of the relative importance of inputs represent a higher level of importance, while the values vary with the stock; hence, to avoid differences in the input variables of the stock prediction model, the values are arranged in order, and the first three values are taken as the independent variables (X) for the subsequent models used for predicting the dependent variables (Y) of future stock prices.
0.188928 - This study employs the simple regression model using the forced entry method to validate the accuracy of the forecasted stock prices.
0.161268 - (ii) C&RT: C&RT is used in the prediction tree models.
0.093458 - C&RT does not require a long time to train the model, and its interpretation is comparatively easy to understand.
0.050000 - Binary nodes will be generated from analyzing the C&RT results.
0.077027 - Assuming that the initial binary node (node 0) is X1, and the parent node further splits into two child nodes (X2, X3).
0.067416 - If the tree depth is 2, there will be X1, X2, … , X7, i.e.
0.039216 - a total of seven significant reference entities.
0.181741 - The study uses these seven reference entities (X1, X2, … , X7) as the input variable (X) for subsequent prediction models for predicting future stock prices (Y).
0.092409 - However, there may be duplication among these seven reference entities due to different information for the various stocks.
0.067416 - Thus, the final number of input variables (X) may not be always the same.
0.207091 - (iii) Hybrid model: Besides the above two algorithms, the study also proposes a hybrid model to predict stock prices.
0.127716 - The hybrid model does not consist of complex algorithms.
0.106526 - First, it derives prediction models from the original ANN and C&RT models, and carries out union operations on these two models.
0.098361 - As such, the independent variable included in this model’s regression equation will be more than the number of independent variables in other algorithm methods.
0.112756 - Where the least number of independent variables exist, the hybrid model may be similar to the original ANN or C&RT models.
0.090667 - Finally, we studied relative prediction performance and absolute prediction performance to see if they match our expectations, so as to verify the accuracy of the model.
0.135606 - Relative predicted results refer mainly to the comparison between the three algorithm methods, to determine which of the algorithm methods produces relatively stable predictions and are closest to the actual stock prices.
0.133760 - Absolute prediction performance refers to the algorithm method, whose predicted outcomes are the most accurate, and which could predict with precision the closing prices of the current day’s stock prices.
0.066667 - Artificial neural networks analysis Taking Stock Code 3064 as an example.
0.109631 - Using ANN analysis, we found the estimated accuracy to be 96.58%, and the relative importance of the top three figures is represented as X1, X2, X3.

0.152153 - Comparative analysis of performance In the actual prediction of stock prices, observation is done in two parts: relative prediction performance, and absolute prediction performance.
0.095238 - Relative prediction performance looks at the stability of the prediction.
0.018018 - Observation dates are 1 July to 14 August 2009.
0.122449 - A total of 32 sets of data are used to verify the prediction capability of the model.
0.123168 - Because of the difficulties in delivering 100% accuracy in predicting the current day’s closing stock prices, whether comprising a rise or a fall, we use prediction error ratio (PER) to measure the prediction performance.
0.081995 - As the PERs of different stocks differ, and in order to avoid inconsistent measurements, the PER is used to derive the data range, from which, we calculate the 20%-value closest to the minimum value (implies prediction is closer to accuracy) and rate it as “A”, values falling between 20% and 50% are rated “B”, and values greater than 50% are rated “C”.
0.099010 - The more “A” ratings there are, the greater the number of accurately predicted values, the greater the stability.
0.039216 - Please refer to Fig 1 for details.
0.131333 - Bar graph of stock price prediction performance ratings Fig 1.
0.142579 - Bar graph of stock price prediction performance ratings.
0.144619 - According to Fig 1, ANN outperforms both C&RT (97 > 79) and the hybrid model (97 > 88) in terms of overall prediction results.
0.143744 - On the other hand, the hybrid model did better than ANN in terms of stability (88 > 79).
0.088353 - The results show that the three models produce clearly different prediction results.
0.051948 - It does not represent absolute prediction performance in Fig 1.
0.093179 - Hence, we need to calculate the absolute prediction performance, and the closer the prediction error ratio is to zero, the greater the degree of accuracy.
0.098246 - Daily opening prices fluctuate according to the median value of the previous day’s closing prices.
0.085911 - Current day’s price intervals will see a largest rise or largest fall of 7% from the median value, which means that the current day’s greatest magnitude in price fluctuation could be as high as 14%, and more than 14% if compared to the previous day’s prices.
0.078101 - The study is based on PER being smaller than 0.02, i.e.
0.192670 - a valid prediction is when the predicted stock prices differ from the actual stock prices by only 2%.
0.100295 - The total number of valid predictions divided by the total number of predictions is the actual prediction performance (refer to Fig 2).
0.131333 - Stock price total prediction accuracy of different methods Fig 2.
0.142579 - Stock price total prediction accuracy of different methods.
0.201252 - We can therefore deduce that using ANN to predict the closing prices of stocks is more in line with actual stock prices.
0.054054 - A total of 49 data sets are accurately predicted.
0.125078 - Therefore, for ANN, there is a 15.31% probability that a valid prediction will occur across all samples; C&RT is 14.06%; the hybrid model is 13.75%.
0.041026 - This is different from prediction stability.
0.157350 - Although the total prediction accuracy for C&RT and the hybrid model differs only by 1, compared to the hybrid model, C&RT produces a more even rating distribution among the 10 sample stocks.
0.124200 - Hence, we believe that prediction accuracy is better for C&RT than the hybrid model.
0.219549 - Between the three models, ANN demonstrates the greatest stability and accuracy at predicting stock prices during the post-crisis period.
0.138692 - And although C&RT is less stable than the hybrid model, it is more accurate.
0.146456 - The hybrid model proposed by the study clearly produces different prediction results.
0.109195 - This implies that integrated use of C&RT and ANN require improved efficiency and further development and more in-depth study is necessary.
0.173469 - By simply using the closing prices of stocks, the study has managed to discover stocks with good investment value.
0.085271 - However, the ever-changing market also implies a broad spectrum of impact factors.
0.170961 - In terms of stock analysis, data mining is an effective tool for discovering the correlation between stocks of a different cluster, so as to provide investors with a simple method for predicting stock prices.
0.109453 - For future studies, other stock selection criteria may be included, and when combined with the characteristics of the relevant algorithm methods, we could develop the most appropriate prediction criteria.
0.159666 - However, although predicted stock prices may be used as a reference, they are not the main deciding factors.
0.048193 - Prudent investment decisions must be supported by a company’s financial statements.
0.109441 - There are some limitations to the study: first, samples collected are for the period of July 2008–June 2009 (one year).
0.094708 - However, this is not a complete fiscal year, and the time period is relatively short.
0.034632 - Nonetheless, it may be viewed as a full business cycle.
0.160431 - Inclusion of stock prices of the past 3–5 years would upset the original sample.
0.126789 - On the contrary, during the period of data collection, the stock market exhibited fairly large fluctuations.
0.046948 - Difficulty of predictability also implies more meaningful results.
0.122893 - Secondly, in verifying the models’ performance, we used 32 days as the actual verification period for accuracy.
0.084577 - We took into consideration the impact of the market’s movements on the changes to the prediction models, and that the original prediction model might lose its predictive ability.
0.178368 - Thirdly, the samples were digital content stocks.
0.069767 - The high correlation between companies’ businesses results in a rather high R2 value.
0.081633 - If all OTC stocks were used as input factors for our prediction, R2 would have been lower.
0.108903 - Also, different stock markets may result in different outcomes.

[Frase 7] The study also discovers that compared to the other two methods, ANN is a more stable method for predicting stock prices in the volatile post-crisis stock market.
[Frase 4] This study looks at artificial neural networks (ANN), decision trees and the hybrid model of ANN and decision trees (hybrid model), the three common algorithm methods used for numerical analysis, to forecast stock prices.
[Frase 192] Although the total prediction accuracy for C&RT and the hybrid model differs only by 1, compared to the hybrid model, C&RT produces a more even rating distribution among the 10 sample stocks.
[Frase 194] Between the three models, ANN demonstrates the greatest stability and accuracy at predicting stock prices during the post-crisis period.
