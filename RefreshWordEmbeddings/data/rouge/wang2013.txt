0.029304 - Suppose that data has been preprocessed into .
0.048565 - Fig 6 shows a scenario map formation process by IdeaGraph and the algorithm is presented as below: Step 1: Generating general clusters.
0.012461 - The relationship between two items is measured by their conditional probability.
0.041995 - That is, the relationship of any two items, Ii and Ij, is calculated by Eq (1).
0.033501 - And then the pairs whose R(x, y) are greater than preset threshold r are linked by solid line in the graph G. In this way, general clusters are obtained and denoted by Ci.
0.054581 - (1) Step 2: Obtaining cognitive clusters.Cognitive Cluster is defined as a cluster which contains rich information but should be small enough for human cognition and interpretation.
0.054683 - To obtain cognitive cluster, information and information density, these two indicators are employed to quantify general clusters generated in Step 1.
0.057554 - The definition of information is the sum of R(Ii, Ij) of all the edges in a general cluster.
0.054422 - The information density is defined that the information of a cluster is divided by the number of items in the cluster.
0.061069 - That means the information density of a cluster is the information of each item in this cluster.
0.059902 - Thus the equations of information and information density are (2) (3) where Ii or Ij is an item of a cluster C and Ne indicates the number of items in the cluster C. Eq (4) is derived from merging Eqs.
0.035556 - (2) and (3).
0.022409 - Therefore, each general cluster is measured by the harmonic average of these two indicators.
0.036281 - (4) Eq (4) indicates that it favors the cluster which has fewer items when two general clusters have the same information.
0.047863 - Therefore, all general clusters are ranked by their ClusterVal (C) in a descending order and parts of them are chosen as cognitive clusters denoted by CC through picking up the top Nc clusters.
0.000000 - Step 3: Capturing valuable links.
0.034783 - Calculate the relationship between each item and each cognitive cluster by Eq (5).
0.055944 - (5) where ck is an item of a cognitive cluster CC and Ii is an item outside the cluster CC.
0.041958 - Then, item-cluster pairs are sorted and the top M1 pairs are selected to be linked by red dot line.
0.019185 - The new items are added if they do not appear in the graph G. Step 4: Extracting key items.
0.055914 - A key item is the item which has strong relationship with all the other cognitive clusters and newly added items in Step 3.
0.034783 - The key value Key(I) of an item is calculated by Eq (6).
0.024955 - (6) All items are sorted by their Key(I) and the top Nk items are taken as key items which are added in the graph G if they do not exist.
