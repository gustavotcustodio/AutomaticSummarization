0.086086 - Asparagus (Asparagus offcinalis L., family Liliaceae) is a healthy and nutritious vegetable, containing antioxidants, such as rutin, ascorbic acid, tocopherol, ferulic acid and glutathione (Shao et al., 1997).
0.113701 - Ascorbic acid (AA) is an important component of our nutrition and used as additive in many foods because of its antioxidant capacity, however, it is known to be thermolabile and is easily destroyed during processing, especially thermal treatments (Garrote, Silva, & Bertone, 1986).
0.032680 - Blanching is one of the many processes that take place during the preparation of raw vegetables before preservation processes like canning and freezing.
0.134103 - Quantitative representation of kinetic data has also been extensively reported in an attempt to predict and optimize ascorbic acid retention during blanching and storage.

0.118981 - Vegetables are a major source of ascorbic acid, a nutrient that besides its vitamin action is valuable for its antioxidant effect.
0.067196 - Asparagus is a green vegetable with high antioxidant activity among the commonly consumed vegetables (Vinson, Hao, Su, & Zubik, 1998).
0.054155 - Our data showed that the content of AA was highest in bud segment of asparagus (0.91 ± 0.04 mg/100 ml juice), followed by upper segment (0.72 ± 0.06 mg/100 ml juice), middle segment (0.58 ± 0.06 mg/100 ml juice) and was least in butt segment (0.48 ± 0.04 mg/100 ml juice).
0.112200 - However, Nindo, Sun, Wang, Tang, and Powers (2003) reported that the middle and basal parts contained more ascorbic acid than the tip portion of asparagus.
0.049058 - Although AA is an important component of our nutrition, it is the least stable of all vitamins and is easily destroyed during processing, especially thermal treatments, because of its thermolability.
0.000000 - Garrote et al.
0.043011 - (1986) observed that the main mechanisms of AA loss during the blanching operation are thermal induced degradation or by leaching.
0.082011 - Our results demonstrated that the AA content in asparagus decreased depending on the blanching time and temperature (Fig 4).
0.134392 - Moreover, AA degradation in asparagus during blanching has been described by a first-order reaction model in our experiment.
0.086736 - In fact, the first-order kinetic model has been applied by many researchers (Frias & Oliveira, 2001; Frias, Oliveira, Cunha, & Oliveira, 1998; Giannakourou & Taoukis, 2003; Johnson et al., 1995; Uddin, Hawlader, Ding, & Mujumdar, 2002) for evaluating AA degradation in biological materials of food system.
0.064327 - According to Table 6, high activation energies and Q10 values in middle and butt segments indicated that AA degradation was more temperature dependent than the other segments.
0.188213 - The lowest Ea value for AA degradation was obtained in bud segment of asparagus.
0.061303 - The lowest activation energies for AA degradation are also remarkable since this reaction is favoured at low temperatures.
0.057288 - In addition, the t1/2 and D-value of AA loss in bud segment were lower than the other segments at the same blanching temperature (Tables 2–5).
0.131313 - Therefore, bud segment is more liable to lose AA than the other segments.
0.047619 - From a nutritional point of view, the extent of AA retention is a widely adopted quality criterion.
0.062520 - Therefore, many authors have proposed mathematical models and computer simulations predicting ascorbic acid loss during processing and storage (Haralampu & Karel, 1983; Mishkin et al., 1984; Vieira et al., 2000; Villota & Karel, 1980).
0.035601 - Recently, artificial neural network (ANN) has generated increasing acceptance and is an interesting method in several food processing applications like sensory analysis and quality control (Buciński, Zieliński, & Kozłowska, 2004; Cabrera & Prieto, 2010; Lewis et al., 2008; O’Farrell, Lewis, Flanagan, Lyons, & Jackman, 2005; Panigrahi, Balasubramanian, Gu, Logue, & Marchello, 2006), classifications (Gestal et al., 2004; Nadal, Espinosa, Schuhmacher, & Domingo, 2004), shelf life (Siripatrawan & Jantawat, 2008), microbiology (Garcı´a-Gimeno, Hervás-Martı´nez, & de Sióniz, 2002), drying applications (Kamiński & Tomczak, 2000; Kerdpiboon, Kerr, & Devahastin, 2006; Tripathy & Kumar, 2009), thermal process (Chen & Ramaswamy, 2003; Gonçalves, Minim, Coimbra, & Minim, 2005), food freezing (Goñi, Oddone, Segura, Mascheroni, & Salvadori, 2008; Mittal & Zhang, 2000).
0.046498 - ANN is a powerful mathematical tool that is capable of approximating any underlying relationship between the dependent and independent variables, learning from examples through iteration, without requiring a prior knowledge of the relationships of the process parameters.
0.055556 - Moreover, its structure is relatively simple, with connections in parallel and sequence between neurons, which means a short computing time and a high potential of robustness and adaptive performance (Palancar et al., 1998).
