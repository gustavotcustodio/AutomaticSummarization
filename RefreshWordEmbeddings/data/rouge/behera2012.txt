0.090909 - Each layer consists of several neurons and the layers are connected by the connection weights ( and ).
0.080972 - The most commonly used transfer function is the sigmoid function as described by (1) This produces output in the range of 0–1 and introduces non-linearity into the network, which gives the power to capture non-linear relationships.
0.121212 - The back propagation network is the most prevalent supervised ANN learning model (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986).
0.085859 - It uses the gradient descent algorithm to correct the weights between interconnected neurons (Maier & Dandy, 2001).
0.100309 - During the learning process of the network, the algorithm computes the error between the predicted and specified target values at the output layer.

0.059829 - Data pre-processing and division The data points from all the EFF systems, operated at initial concentrations of 0.1, 0.55 and 1 ppm were normalized and scaled (Eq (3)) to the range of 0–1, so as to suit the transfer function in the hidden (sigmoid) and output layer (linear).
0.083624 - More comprehensible and relevant information on the different types of transfer function, algorithms and internal parameter used for developing ANN models are given elsewhere (Haykin, 1994; Hoskins & Himmelblau, 1988) (3) where is the normalized value, Xmin and Xmax are the minimum and maximum values of X, respectively.
0.011905 - This processed data was later divided into two sets; training and testing.
0.099307 - 80% (8) of the data points were used for training the network, while 20% (2) were used for testing the developed network.
0.099800 - Model-inputs and outputs The input vectors to the network were the easily monitored parameters namely; input concentration (X1) and flow rate (X2).
0.152343 - The output of the ANN model was the times (day) corresponding to the six concentration levels.
0.093023 - The six concentration levels considered are those corresponding to the non-dimensional parameter (C/Co) values of 1%, 5%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 95%.
0.000000 - These outputs are denoted as T1, T5, T25, T50, T75 and T95, respectively.

0.010499 - Besides, breakpoints at 1% and 5% are commonly used in water and wastewater treatment applications.
0.066368 - Internal network parameters A good network architecture requires proper selection of sensitive parameters like: number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer (NH), the activation function f(x), the learning rate of the network (η), epoch size (ε), momentum term (α) and training cycles (TC).
0.070423 - The network architecture has to be optimized to reduce computer processing, achieve good predictability and avoid over fitting.
0.111939 - The learning rate (η) and momentum (α) can play an important role in the convergence of the network.
0.125683 - The η value of a network affects the size of steps taken in weight space.
0.119048 - If η is too small, the algorithm would take more time to converge.
0.099307 - The momentum term (α) accelerates the convergence of the error during the learning process by adding a fraction to the precious weight update.
0.107056 - The values of η and α varies between 0 and 1 and is normally estimated by trial and error.
0.093418 - Initially, network training based on a trial and error approach was used to identify the best suitable range of these parameters.
0.086336 - A detailed study on the effect of internal network parameter on the performance of back propagation neural network (BPNN) and the procedure involved in selecting the best network topology has been described elsewhere (Maier & Dandy, 1998).
0.092921 - Selecting the best model architecture The performance of the training and test data set were evaluated in terms of the correlation coefficient values (R2), which substantially determines the closeness of prediction between the desired and predicted output from the network.
0.151336 - This is given by: (4) where X is the experimental value, Y is the model predicted value, and N is the total number of observations.
0.060264 - Furthermore, for the testing data set, the total mean squared error (RMSE) was computed according to the formulae given elsewhere (Elias, Berastegi, Arias, & Barona, 2006).
0.101885 - Software used ANN based predictive modeling was carried out using the shareware version of the neural network and multivariable statistical modeling software NNMODEL (version 1.4, neural fusion, NY).
0.137488 - The same software was also used to carry out the sensitivity analysis.
0.017544 - Column studies Continuous tests were carried out under abiotic conditions at three different initial concentrations and flow-rates (Table 2).
0.105954 - The inlet and outlet concentrations of both triclosan and ibuprofen were measured every day, and the results were interpreted in terms of the trend of C/Co, to achieve breakthrough.
0.120155 - The time course C/Co profile of triclosan and ibuprofen, at all the tested conditions is illustrated in Fig 4(a) and (b), respectively.
0.087986 - It can be observed clearly that, the onset of breakthrough condition differed depending on the initial setting of flow rate (Q) and initial concentration (Co), for both the compounds.
0.155519 - It is also evident that the breakthrough time in both cases decreased with an increase of Co and Q.
0.024922 - At lower Co and Q, breakthrough occurred slower and vice versa.
0.112037 - These results demonstrate that the change of concentration and flow rate affects the saturation rate of sorbent and breakthrough time, which are the typical characteristics of any adsorption process.
0.058104 - With the increase of Co and Q, the loading rate of the selected pharmaceuticals increased, and consequently the fixed-bed EFF column became saturated with the pharmaceutical concentration as the effluent approached the Co. For both triclosan and ibuprofen, high flow rate and high concentration (5 m/d and 1 ppm) favored this phenomenon.
0.034364 - Breakthrough curves; triclosan (a) and ibuprofen (b) Fig 4.
0.030651 - Breakthrough curves; triclosan (a) and ibuprofen (b).
0.102247 - The breakthrough curves shifted to the origin at same Co (0.1 and 1 ppm) with increasing Q, and earlier breakthrough time was observed for the higher flow rate.
0.066116 - In the interval of 70 d, the value of C/Co for triclosan reached 0.51 and 0.85 at Co of 0.1 ppm and flow rates 1 m/d and 5 m/d, respectively (Fig 4a).
0.070175 - Similarly, in the same interval of time and at the same Co, the value of C/Co for ibuprofen reached 0.43 and 0.99 when flow rates were 1 m/d and 5 m/d, respectively (Fig 4b).
0.000000 - Similar phenomena were also observed at higher Co (1 ppm) and at different flow rates (1 m/d and 5 m/d).
0.050265 - For example, the values of C/Co reached at Co of 1 ppm and flow rates 1 m/d and 5 m/d were 0.33, and 0.79 and 0.16, and 0.98, respectively for triclosan and ibuprofen.
0.080679 - The variation in the adsorption capacity at various Co and Q can be explained on the basis of mass transfer fundamentals.
0.088617 - The breakthrough time at Q = 1 m/d is longer than that at Q = 5 m/d because it takes a longer time to reach its effective bed load when the other operating conditions are held at their respective constant values.
0.132790 - Therefore, as Q increases, the breakthrough curve becomes steeper, because of the shorter time required to attain its effective bed load.
0.100435 - In other words, increasing Q decreases the effective bed load or the effective adsorption capacity of the EFF column.
0.102564 - This phenomenon is usually expected because the effective bed load reduces with increasing Q and hence requires a shorter time for breakthrough of bed (Ruthven, 1984).
0.103093 - On the other hand, a close examination of Figs.
0.123720 - 4a and b reveals that at the same Q, the value of breakthrough time decreased with an increase in Co values.
0.162883 - The larger the Co, the steeper the slope of the breakthrough curve and smaller the breakthrough time.
0.024922 - At low Co, breakthrough curves were dispersed and breakthrough occurred slower.
0.112150 - As the value of Co increased, sharper breakthrough curves were obtained.
0.058394 - This can be explained by the fact that more adsorption sites were covered with increase in Co.
0.099307 - These results demonstrated that the change in concentration gradient affected both the saturation rate and breakthrough time (Knaebel, Ruthven, Humphrey, & Carr, 1999).
0.064298 - As Co increased, the loading rate of triclosan and ibuprofen increased, so does the driving force or mass transfer, which results in a decrease in the adsorption zone length.
0.064611 - This result is in agreement with the works reported previously on various fixed-bed adsorption systems, where a wide variety of environmental chemicals were tested (Ahmad & Hameed, 2010; Lua & Jia, 2009; Singh, Srivastava, & Mall, 2009).

0.108472 - The number of neurons in the input layer (NI = 2) and output layer (N0 = 6) were chosen based on the number of input and output variables to the network.
0.107074 - However, in order to get the best/optimum network parameters, in most instances, literature suggests the use of a trial and error approach where the performance goal is set by the user.
0.096660 - The best network architecture (Table 4) was chosen based on the maximum predictability of the network for the test data by analyzing the correlation coefficient values (R2).
0.090873 - The model was trained using different combinations of these network parameters, viz., learning rate, momentum term and number of neurons in the hidden layer, so as to achieve maximum correlation coefficient values (target value = 1, i.e., 100% correlation between measured and predicted variables).
0.060914 - This was achieved by a vigorous trial and error approach by keeping some training parameters constant and by slowly moving the other parameters over a wide range of values.
0.100834 - Increasing the number of neurons from 2 to 4 in the hidden layer (NH), increased the R2 value, while values larger than 4 did not show any improvement in the predictive ability of the developed model.
0.094162 - Due to the high R2 observed under this particular setting of network parameters (R2 > 0.95), this value of NH was kept constant at 4.
0.058361 - Thus, by keeping the number of neurons in the hidden layer constant, the values of both learning rate and momentum term was slowly changed from 0.1 to 0.95, through a series of trial and errors, and by observing the changes of R2 in the training data set.
0.098139 - It was observed that, lower values of these parameters decreased the R2, from 0.98 to 0.87, while higher values showed maximum predictive potential for the developed model.
0.000000 - Thus these values were then set at 0.9 and 0.8, respectively.

0.092753 - The delay in achieving breakthrough, i.e., at low flow rates and concentrations would have caused an impact in the neural networks learning/generalization pattern while predicting the performance parameter.
