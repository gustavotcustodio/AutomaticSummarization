0.050505 - This subsection discusses and summarizes the results of the test problem considered in this study.
0.188258 - The performances of the PSO algorithms were evaluated by considering the supply chain test problem, supply chain setting.
0.099659 - Twenty demand scenarios are considered in this study to evaluate the performance of the proposed PSO variants.
0.046205 - For all the 20 scenarios demand rates are generated using the uniform distribution with a minimum demand of 50 units and a maximum demand of 100 units for SCS.
0.109837 - Same demand settings are considered to comparatively evaluate the performances of the PSO algorithms considered in this study.
0.076006 - The performances of the heuristic methodologies are analyzed by the quality of the solutions yielded and computational effort required to obtain the best solution.
0.061945 - To test the solution quality, statistical analysis has been carried out to find whether there exists any significant difference between the mean TSCC values yielded by different solution methodologies of PSO variants (i.e.
0.052288 - B-PSO, LDIW-PSO, CFM-PSO and NLIW-PSO).
0.099036 - For fair comparison, the proposed PSO algorithms were tested on the same computer platform by fixing the same number of iterations.
0.097418 - TSCC obtained, after running the PSO variants to a maximum number of iterations are reported in Tables 9–12.
0.050955 - The table also gives the mean, best, worst, and standard deviation value of TSCC over 15 replications for each scenario.

0.010101 - All other heuristic methodologies yielded solutions, which are not so significantly different from each other.
0.072111 - To evaluate best performing algorithm for the SCS, the mean relative percentage error or increase in the objective function value is evaluated.
0.044974 - To evaluate the best performing algorithm, the best and mean relative percentage increase in TSCC are calculated by using above equation and the data are tabulated in Table 13 and in Table 15 and pictorially shown in Fig 4.
0.046891 - It is seen from the outperformed matrix Table 14 for best value of TSCC and Table 16 for mean value of TSCC, that for most of problem instances, Non linear inertia weight approach (NLIW-PSO) perform very well and produces better quality solutions when compared with other variants of PSO and GA.

[Frase 6] This paper specifically deals with the modeling and optimization of a three echelon supply chain network using the particle swarm optimization/intelligence algorithms.
[Frase 95] In this work, different variations of particle swarm optimization algorithms are used for solving constrained multi echelon supply chain network problems with the objective of minimizing total supply chain operating cost (TSCC).
[Frase 291] Four particle swarm optimization algorithms are proposed for the application to solve three echelons SCN architecture and the results were compared with Genetic algorithm.
[Frase 34] An emerging principle for the management of supply chains is that a supply chain perspective provides the opportunity for significant savings in inventories from the better coordination and proper scheduling purchasing, production and distribution of goods across the supply chain network.
