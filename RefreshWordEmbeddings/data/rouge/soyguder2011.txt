0.043011 - In Section 5, the experimental results are presented.
0.000000 - Finally, conclusions are given in Section 6.
0.035794 - We use adaptive background subtraction process and histogram based mean shift tracking algorithm respectively which are described in more detail as follows.
0.000000 - Adaptive background subtraction techniques can be classified into two broad categories (Cheung & Kamath, 2004): non-recursive and recursive.
0.011019 - In non-recursive background modeling techniques, a sliding-window approach is used for background estimation.
0.036697 - A fixed number of frames is used and stored in a buffer.
0.051680 - Recursive background modeling techniques do not keep track of a buffer containing a number of history frames.
0.047198 - Instead, it recursively updates a single background model based on each incoming frame.
0.056566 - In this article, we used one of the recursive techniques (will be mentioned at next), since they require less storage than non-recursive techniques (Smith, 2006).
0.037267 - A common pixel-level background subtraction method consists of subsequent two steps to decide whether a pixel belongs to background (BG) or foreground object (FG).
0.064646 - At the first step, probability value of each pixel is calculated by (1) where xt is the value of a pixel at time t in RGB.
0.070393 - At the second step, probability values calculated for each pixel are compared with a threshold value to decide whether the pixel belong to the background.
0.000000 - (2) where cthr is a threshold value.
0.068966 - However, the traditional pixel-level methods are very sensitive to illumination change in the scene and do not provide desired results.
0.035772 - Therefore, we use a robust pixel-level method (Zirkovic & Heijden, 2005) which uses Gaussian mixture model with B components for each pixel in image: (3) where μm and σm are respectively, means and variances of GMM.
0.108932 - The mixing weights denoted by π are non-negative and describe how much of the data belongs to the mth component of the GMM.
0.080791 - Besides, the GMM algorithm can select automatically the needed number of component per pixel and update π, σ and σ values by using recursive procedure.
0.052009 - After the background subtraction process, we have some binary objects which contain human blobs and other objects together with artifacts.
0.041298 - Cleaning non human blobs and artifacts, we need to apply some morphological operation.
0.046784 - Together with applying on opening and closing operations morphologically, we measure a set of properties which are convex hull (smallest convex polygon that can contain the object), solidity (the proportion of the pixels in the convex hull), and eccentricity (eccentricity of the ellipse that has the same second-moments as the object) for each detected object.
0.039448 - Our experiments show that common human blobs should have ranges as follows: Afterward determines human blobs in crowded environments, we need to track only one desired person.
0.099291 - For tracking process, we prefer to use a modified version of the histogram based mean shift algorithm (Comaniciu & Meer, 2002).
0.073733 - After obtain rigid human bodies by using processes of the adaptive background subtraction and morphological cleaning, the center of the desired human blob is tracked approximately using the histogram based mean shift algorithms assuming a rigid object shape model.
0.064865 - This accurately resolves most of the translation component of object motion and might resolve some rotation if not excessive (which is usually the case assuming high frame rates relative to speeds).
0.037113 - We update the center of the desired human blob using the following procedure: (1) the center position of each landmark is calculated; (2) 3D color histogram distribution function q belonging to the model object region (surrounded by mask human blob obtained by adaptive background subtraction process) is determined; (3) at each mean shift iteration, we calculate the 3D color histogram distribution function p belonging to the candidate object region and eliminate the differences between q and p (process could be referred to as background elimination); (4) given q and p, the weight at any element x of 3D histogram is derived from the Bhattacharyya measure and is given by: (4) where w(x) defines how likely the pixel color I(x) belong to an object model q.
0.118203 - After estimating the center translation amount via mean shift, it is updated to the prior information of the center point.
0.059770 - In this section, the theoretical foundations for the intelligent modeling used in the presented study are given in the following subsections.
0.010667 - Wavelet transform Wavelet transforms are finding inverse use in fields as diverse as telecommunications and biology.
0.034682 - Because of their suitability for analyzing non-stationary signals, they have become a powerful alternative to Fourier methods in many medical applications, where such signals abound (Daubechies, 1998).
0.066986 - The main advantages of wavelets is that they have a varying window size, being wide for slow frequencies and narrow for the fast ones, thus leading to an optimal time−frequency resolution in all the frequency ranges.
0.101149 - Furthermore, owing to the fact that windows are adapted to the transients of each scale, wavelets lack the requirement of stationary.
0.041344 - A wavelet expansion is Fourier series expansion, but is defined by a two-parameter family of functions.
0.063796 - It can be defined as follows: (5) where i and j are integers, the functions are the wavelet expansion functions and the two-parameter expansion coefficients are called the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients of f(x).
0.051037 - The coefficients are given by (6) The wavelet basis functions can be computed from a function called the generating or mother wavelet through translation and dilation (7) where j is the translation and i the dilation parameter.
0.033058 - Mother wavelet function is not unique, but it must satisfy a small set of conditions.
0.053333 - One of them is multi-resolution condition and related to the two-scale difference equation (8) where is scaling function and h(k) must satisfy several conditions to make basis wavelet functions unique, orthonormal and have a certain degree of regularity.
0.082596 - The mother wavelet is related to the scaling function as follows: (9) where .
0.000000 - At this point, if valid h(x) is available, one can obtain g(x).

0.005926 - J-level wavelet decomposition can be computed with Eq (10) as follows: (10) where coefficient are given and coefficients and coefficient and at scale j + 1 and they can be obtained if coefficient at scale j is available; (11) 3.2.
0.065728 - Wavelet packet decomposition As an extension of the standard wavelets, wavelet packet represent a generalization of multi-resolution analysis and use the entire family of subband decomposition to generate an overcomplete representation of signals (Wang, Teo, & Lin, 2001).
0.042389 - Wavelet decomposition uses the fact that it is possible to resolve high frequency components within a small time window, while only low frequency components need large time windows.
0.000000 - This is because a low frequency component completes a cycle in a large time interval whereas a high frequency component completes a cycle in a much shorter interval.
0.000000 - Therefore, slow varying components can only be identified over long time intervals but fast varying components can be identified over short time intervals.
0.000000 - Wavelet decomposition can be regarded as a continuous time wavelet decomposition sampled at different frequencies at every level or scale.
0.044610 - The wavelet decomposition functions at level m and time location tm can be expressed as (12) where is the decomposition filter at frequency level m. The effect of the decomposition filter is scaled by the factor 2m at stage m, but otherwise the shape is the same at all scales (Devasahayam, 2000).
0.071987 - Wavelet packet analysis is an extension of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) (Burrus, Gopinath, & Guo, 1998) and it turns out that the DWT is only one of the much possible decomposition that could be performed on the signal.
0.072187 - Instead of just decomposing the low frequency component, it is therefore possible to subdivide the whole time–frequency plane into different time–frequency pieces.
0.074450 - The advantage of wavelet packet analysis is that it is possible to combine the different levels of decomposition in order to achieve the optimum time–frequency representation of the original (Turkoglu, Arslan, & Ilkay, 2003).
