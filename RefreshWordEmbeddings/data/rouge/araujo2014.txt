A new artificial life model for image enhancement is proposed. The new model is based on the behavior of an intelligent organism. The model is evaluated using synthetic and real images with different levels of noise. Different quality metrics are used to assess the model efficiency.

0.225312 - In this work, a method to enhance images based on a new artificial life model is presented.
0.200149 - The model is inspired on the behavior of a herbivore organism, when this organism is in a certain environment and selects its food.
0.095238 - This organism travels through the image iteratively, selecting the more suitable food and eating parts of it in each iteration.
0.093333 - The path that the organism travels through in the image is defined by a priori knowledge about the environment and how it should move in it.
0.108262 - Here, we modeled the control and perception centers of the organism, as well as the simulation of its actions and effects on the environment.
0.182566 - To demonstrate the efficiency of our method quantitative and qualitative results of the enhancement of synthetic and real images with low contrast and different levels of noise are presented.
0.190634 - Obtained results confirm the ability of the new artificial life model for improving the contrast of the objects in the input images.
0.093333 - The acquisition, transmission and compression process of the images can damage them, making it difficult, for example, to locate and extract information of the represented objects.
0.123054 - Image enhancement techniques have been developed to soften the effect of this damage.
0.080321 - These techniques aim to improve the quality of the images and the contrast between the represented objects, highlighting their most significant features and improving the visual perception of relevant features.
0.072727 - Moreover, they allow the images to be represented more appropriately for further analysis by computational methods.
0.073684 - There are many factors that can contribute to the loss of contrast, such as loss of focus, noise presence, reflexes, shadows and insufficient illumination of the environment during the image acquisition process (Kao, Hsu, & Yang, 2010).
0.068154 - The enhancement of degraded images can be improved using different techniques that can be divided into techniques based on spatial domain, the ones that manipulate directly the pixels in the damaged image, and the techniques based on the frequency domain, that work with the image frequency information, generally obtained by Fourier and Wavelets transforms (Hanmandlu, Jha, & Sharma, 2003; Trifas, Tyler, & Pianykh, 2006).
0.121092 - The image enhancement techniques applied on the spatial domain are widely used and try to manipulate directly the image pixels, performing computational operations on these pixels based on their values.
0.077193 - For example, considering an image in gray scale, where the intensities can have values from 0 (zero) to 255, we verify that the intensities of the original image use only a reduced range of these values.
0.089767 - So, the enhancement methods on the spatial domain try to redistribute the intensities in a way that they can use a wider range of values, improving the perception of the different objects in the image.
0.084613 - Some of the traditional techniques applied on the spatial domain are based in the histogram equalization, normalization, quadratic enhancement, square rooted enhancement and logarithmic enhancement (Gonzalez & Woods, 2006).
0.087165 - The enhancement in the frequency domain has its techniques based on the convolution theorem and can be interpreted as an enhancement extension in the spatial domain, with its operations applied to the image frequencies, usually obtained by the application of a transform, as the Fourier Transform.
0.092308 - After the frequencies manipulation, an inverse transform is applied so that the image can be represented again in the spatial domain.
0.081967 - This kind of enhancement method is generally obtained through filtering techniques, as the high-pass filter (Gonzalez & Woods, 2006).
0.145522 - Recent studies have been adopting models based on artificial life to process tasks of the computational image processing and analysis obtaining effective results.
0.017094 - Examples include brain segmentation in magnetic resonance images (Farag, Suri, Micheli-Tzanakou, Hamarneh, & McIntosh, 2007; Feng, Wang, & Luo, 2008; McInerney, Hamarneh, Shenton, & Terzopoulos, 2002; Prasad, Joshi, Feng, et al., 2011; Prasad, Joshi, Thompson, et al., 2011), and features extraction and classification from medical images (Srinivasan & Sundaram, 2013).
0.109183 - The use of these artificial life models, better known in computational image processing, tries to make a deformable “living” model provided with a “primitive brain” capable of making decisions in search of the best results in the segmentation process.
0.216037 - The objective of this paper is to present a new method based on artificial life to image enhancement based on the modeling of an organism, in particular, its control and perception centers.
0.118537 - On the contrary of what is common in image segmentation processes using artificial life models, our model is not inspired in the organism’s shape, that is, the geometry of the organism’s body, but in its behavior when it is located in a certain environment and performs the food selection process.
0.092189 - With the proposed enhancement method, it is intended to enhance images with low contrast and images affected by noise interference, highlighting the transitions between presented objects, and at the same time avoiding enhancing the noise that affects the original image quality.
0.136362 - The results of the proposed enhancement method using the developed model allow us to conclude that this method is promising, being capable of considerably improving the visual perception and the quality of the affected images.
0.182169 - Another contribution of this work is the innovating utilization of artificial life models as enhancement image techniques.
0.170933 - This paper is organized as follows: in the next section, a review about existing artificial life models is presented.
0.198535 - In Section 3, the proposed model is described.
0.067797 - Experimental results are presented and discussed in Section 4, following the obtained conclusions and suggestions for future work.
0.114374 - The studies related with computational image processing and analysis try to develop methods capable of manipulating complex images with different features, in an efficient, robust and reliable way.
0.028192 - Various computational methods to different tasks can be found in the literature, such as for noise removal (Cao, Luo, & Yang, 2011; Chen, Sun, & Xia, 2010; Zhang, Dong, Zhang, & Shi, 2010a), enhancement (Cheng & Xu, 2000; Cheng, Xue, & Shi, 2003; Cho & Bui, 2014; Lai, Chung, Lin, & Chen, 2012), segmentation (Ma, Jorge, ao Manuel, & Tavares, 2010; Nomura, Yamanaka, Katai, Kawakami, & Shiose, 2005; Xue et al., 2003), tracking (Nguyen & Ranganath, 2012; Pinho & Tavares, 2009), registration (Oliveira, Pataky, & Tavares, 2010; Oliveira, Sousa, Santos, & Tavares, 2011) and recognition (Papa, Falcão, de Albuquerque, & Tavares, 2012).
0.045085 - Besides the diverse tasks that can be made by these methods, many techniques have been used, as Genetic Algorithms (Hashemi, Kiani, Noroozi, & Moghaddam, 2010; Wang & Tan, 2011; Yi, Kim and Jung, 2005), Artificial Neural Networks (Petersen, Deridder, & Handels, 2002; Shkvarko, Atoche, & Torres-Roman, 2011), Active Contours (Ghita & Whelan, 2010; Ma, Tavares, Jorge, & Mascarenhas, 2010), Region Growing (Fan, Zeng, Body, & Hacid, 2005; Peter, Bousson, Bergot, & Peyrin, 2008), models based on differential equations and finite elements (Chao & Tsai, 2010; Yu, Tan, & Wang, 2010).
0.148129 - A research field based on artificial life has emerged in the computer graphics area for modeling animation behavior and the evolution of plants and animals (Kim & Cho, 2006).
0.079455 - This investigation area has also formed the basis for new researches in computational image processing and analysis (Farag et al., 2007; Feng et al., 2008; Horng, 2011; McInerney et al., 2002; Osuna-Enciso, Cuevas, & Sossa, 2013; Prasad, Joshi, Feng, et al., 2011; Prasad, Joshi, Thompson, et al., 2011), forming the methods called image processing methods based on artificial life models.
0.092963 - The artificial life models address the diverse biological processes that characterize the live species in the attempt to overcome the problems found in the image processing, such as the complexity of the represented objects and low contrast between them and the rest of the represented scene.
0.079889 - The majority of the artificial models used in this area apply techniques based in physical and geometrical principles, aiming to make the used deformable models (Ma, Tavares, et al., 2010) more flexible and capable of performing a better image exploitation, using a priori knowledge of the area associated with the images, and analyzing better the neighborhood of the active model used to control the deformation in a more adequate and robust way.
0.105496 - Making an analogy with the artificial life systems, the geometry of the deformable model is generally considered as being an “organism” (a worm), that keeps changing according to the available a priori knowledge, associated with the information that its sensorial organs return while the organism changes its shape and moves through the image (or environment).
0.096096 - Despite being the most common utilization of the artificial models in image processing, there are many biological processes that can be used as basis for the same models, such as growing, natural selection, evolution, locomotion and learning (Kim & Cho, 2006; McInerney et al., 2002).
0.122810 - Another important issue is that the models based on artificial animal life are more relevant to the image processing techniques, because they present bodies with motor and sensorial organs, and mainly a brain with learning (cognitive system), perception and behavioral centers (Horng, 2011; McInerney et al., 2002).
0.084656 - The motor center coordinates the muscular actions to perform specific actions, as locomotion and the control of the sensorial center.
0.073394 - This last one is used so that the artificial organism acquires information about what happens around it and sends this information to the cognitive center, which is going to decide which actions must be performed to obtain best results according to each situation.
0.079038 - The perception center is the part of the brain that allows the organism to have its sensors trained, being formed by mechanisms that allow it to acquire and understand sensorial information about the environment that surrounds it.
0.094177 - This behavior is useful to perceive the modifications that occur during the processing, since the individual actions can have significant changes in the environment.
0.076503 - The learning center allows the individual to learn how to control all his organs and his behavior through practice.
0.070617 - The behavioral center has the routines with the actions that the individual must perform, considering their perception.
0.176014 - For the creation of an artificial life model, the work-tasks pyramid shown in Fig 1 is usually followed.
0.116856 - Pyramid usually adopted to create an artificial life model (adapted from… Fig 1.
0.116856 - Pyramid usually adopted to create an artificial life model (adapted from (Terzopoulos, 1999)).
0.120219 - Observing the pyramid in Fig 1, from bottom-up, there is the organism’s geometric modeling in its base.
0.087719 - In this layer, the organism’s type is defined, as well as its appearance and geometric morphology.
0.129139 - In the second layer, there is the physical modeling where the biomechanical principles are modeled for simulation and formation of the biological tissues, such as muscles.
0.071795 - The next layer incorporates the motor control routines, which are responsible for stimulating the muscle actuators to allow the locomotion movements.
0.145225 - In the fourth layer, there is the behavior and perception modeling, with an important part, for example, in detecting and navigating between obstacles.
0.098664 - And on the top of the pyramid, the cognitive layer, which is responsible for controlling the acquired knowledge by the organism during the learning process, as well as the planning of the actions to be performed with some level of intelligence.
0.169579 - The computational image processing based on artificial life models uses an analogy between biological processes from certain organisms and the desired operations to do on the images being processed.
0.134469 - One of the objectives of these models is to automate the applied computational methods, making them more robust, efficient and automated to deal with the existing variations in the involved image set.
0.059675 - The organisms used in the models have features that deserve highlighting: they are endowed with a prior knowledge about some features of the environment, namely from the scene, in which they are found; they have sensors that operate in making decisions about the actions to be performed during processing; they have a set of actuators that in association with a knowledge system, allows the organism to adapt to the environment according to the collected data from the sensors.
0.107058 - Some models based on artificial life, such as the ones based on worm, called deformable organisms, have been successfully used in the image segmentation; as in, for example, (Farag et al., 2007; McInerney et al., 2002; Prasad et al., 2011b).
0.073446 - Usually these models have an analogy to worms, considering their great flexibility and their subsequent facility to deformation.
0.042553 - Thus, each organism has a “skeleton” defined to describe its initial shape.
0.103943 - When the organism is placed in an image, it starts a search for a compatible region with the geometry of its skeleton and with the a priori knowledge that it has about the input scene.
0.080702 - When a compatible object is found, a set of sensors and actuators start to work, deforming the worm’s “skeleton” evolving this “skeleton” in order to fully enclose the object’s region in the input image.
0.105552 - Although this technique of artificial intelligence has been wide used for image segmentation with considerably success, it has not been so common for image enhancement.
0.205033 - Hence, we extend it use to enhance the contrast of images by proposing a new artificial life model.
0.148999 - The adopted model is not based on analogy with the organism’s body shape, but on the behavior of a herbivore organism when it is in a specific environment and performs the process of selection of its food.
0.082921 - The organism’s body shape was not considered in this approach because what matters here is the effect that the behavior of this organism produces in the environment, and the shape of its body has no direct influence on the operations considered in this work.
0.091324 - In Fig 2, there is the flow diagram of the proposed method, with the steps of the method described in detail in the following sections.
0.124826 - Flow diagram of the proposed image enhancement method Fig 2.
0.137729 - Flow diagram of the proposed image enhancement method.
0.115369 - Model description The low contrast images problem can be reduced using computational methods for image enhancement, making the difference between different objects more enhanced, allowing us to obtain better results in the later stages of image processing and analysis, such as segmentation and features extraction.
0.088889 - Considering a grayscale image, it is desired that the pixels with low and high intensities are represented so that their intensities are as distinct as possible.
0.099362 - Based on this principle, a good enhancement method in the spatial domain is the one able to verify all pixels of an original image, and recalculate their intensities taking into account the neighbors so that the intensity differences between the pixels belonging to neighboring and distinct regions is increased.
0.172710 - Thus, the model based on artificial life used in the proposed image enhancement method was inspired by the behavior of the herbivorous organisms when they are in a specific environment and perform the selection process of its food.
0.029630 - To this end, it was considered a natural pasture as environment.
0.067416 - These considerations have resulted from the observation that while feeding on a natural pasture, these organisms make a selection of the food, setting a “priority order” of the food to be eaten first.
0.095475 - If we consider an area composed by a single type of food with different heights, there is a tendency that the smaller food will be eaten first.
0.078788 - Usually this happens because the smaller parts are smoother and more nutritious than the bigger ones.
0.103825 - Furthermore, the organism is not fixed in a single point until it eats all of the food available there.
0.071111 - In general, it is always moving in the environment while feeding itself, guided by its cognitive system using the information collected about the food around it.
0.107464 - Thus, the difference between the small and big foods present in a given environment tends to become more evident, at the same way as it is desired in the image enhancement operation.
0.169470 - In the built model, the organism moves iteratively on the image until a threshold for the height of the food is reached.
0.091575 - Modeling the control center The control center has been modeled from the movement operations of the organism, and reduces the height of the food as a result of the eating process performed by organism.
0.058824 - Two control operations are defined in this step: moving and reducing the height (“eat”).
0.072493 - The movement consists in moving the organism from one point to another one on the image, avoiding passing through the same point more than one time at the same iteration.
0.088050 - In each iteration, all pixels of the image are visited and their intensities are recalculated.
0.056689 - To simulate how the organism feeds, the intensity of each point is reduced by considering the following assumptions: usually the organism eats a bit of food that is in the region where it is, but it does not always eat all the food at the same time; the smaller foods are fresher and more nutritious, and they have priority to be consumed.
0.095238 - These assumptions are part of the a priori knowledge set that the organism has about their actions and the environment.
0.065702 - So, considering a local analysis on the image, the smaller its current value, the bigger the reduction of the intensity value of each pixel; i.e., in a very bright pixel a small reduction occurs while in darker pixels a greater reduction, in proportion to its size, is performed in each iteration.
0.104777 - To model this behavior, we adopted the following rational function: (1) where x = 0, 1, … , 255 is the possible intensity values for pixels in the 8-bits images, and k is a positive constant used to control how much of the food height should be reduced at each iteration.
0.099502 - The higher the value of k, the faster the food is reduced and less time is spent to reach the stop criterion.
0.032787 - However, very high values for k cause similar regions to merge quickly, and distinct objects may be wrongly joined.
0.089245 - On the other hand, if its value is too low, the growth of the food can be greater than the amount that is eaten, so the different objects represented in the image can be joined to the image foreground.
0.065844 - As the intensities of the pixels in the input images range from 0 to 255, k was defined as equal to the maximum possible value, i.e., k = 255.
0.067340 - As such, if the intensity of a pixel is 0 (zero), the reduction is also 0 (zero), but if the intensity is 1 (one), then the reduction is almost equal to the total height associated to the pixel.
0.095238 - This behavior is repeated for all pixels with low intensity, and for pixels with high values, the reduction is smaller.
0.091787 - It should be noted that, in the images considered in this work, the pixels belonging to the regions of interest are almost black.
0.059925 - For this reason, it was considered that the best “food” (i.e., the darkest pixels) has the maximum possible height, which was experimentally considered as equal to 10% of the maximum available height.
0.068273 - The function of Eq (1) generates a curve which shows a more significant loss for the pixels with smaller intensity, while those with bigger intensities are less affected, Fig 3.
0.103896 - Thus, the darkest pixels tend to darken faster than the lighter ones, increasing the difference between them and, consequently, improving the enhancement of the image associated area.
0.015504 - Graph for intensity reduction function for k=255 Fig 3.
0.017094 - Graph for intensity reduction function for k = 255.
0.098765 - Modeling the perception center The perception center was modeled according to the priori knowledge of the organism’s behavior, considering the information about the neighborhood acquired by the organism.
0.074906 - The perception center will act primarily to receive the height information of the neighboring points of the organism; i.e., the intensity level, and which points have been visited in a given iteration.
0.115646 - This information is important to choose the way for the organism to go.
0.058957 - To determine how to move in the environment, all 8 (eight) pixels neighboring the pixel occupied by the organism are visited, and at the same time that the intensity of the visited pixel is reduced, the organism stores the coordinates of the pixel with smaller intensity, which is added to its path at the end of the visit to the neighboring pixels.
0.082051 - In addition, the visited pixels are marked as visited, being released for further visits after the end of the current iteration.
0.096045 - This operation allows the organism to walk in a coordinated way in the image, following the darker regions.
0.084656 - However, it may happen that the organism is isolated in a pixel whose all the neighbors have already been visited.
0.074627 - In this case, the organism carries out a search for the nearest pixel that has not yet been visited and continues processing.
0.092085 - This search for the nearest pixel ensures that all pixels on the image are visited, and have their values updated at each iteration.
0.069069 - Effects of the organism’s actions in the environment The organism walking process in the environment following the points with best food generates a secondary effect, which is the damage to the bigger foods during the movement process, since the organism moves over them.
0.057971 - This effect is much common because the big foods are less flexible and are frequently broken when they are pressed, and the broken parts are usually discarded because when food is damaged, it loses its nutritive capability, and it will hardly be consumed by the organism.
0.146648 - Another interesting effect that happens with the adopted model is a consequence of the time that the organism needs to eat all the food available.
0.087432 - Under the considered conditions in the used analogy, many days are usually needed for this process to be performed.
0.082051 - So, as the food is a natural herb, the pieces not yet fully eaten tend to grow as time goes by.
0.045045 - However, very big foods and even those small ones tend to be broken rather than grow, and the high ones break due to their low flexibility, as already previously explained, and the small ones do too because they are young and have low resistance.
0.015504 - Thus, only those foods with middle height usually grow effectively.
0.053221 - So to simulate these effects the function of Eq (2) was adopted, because this one represents an undulating curve, ranging from the approximate range of [−y1, y2], where y1 and y2 belong to the set of real numbers, as can be seen from the curve of Fig 4.
0.063492 - In that curve, the values y1 and y2 are the smallest and the biggest values along the Y-axis, respectively.
0.054292 - This curve allows the performance of an approximate simulation of the degrading operations of the big and small foods and the growth of the intermediate foods according to the course of time: (2) Graph of food’s height loss due to the degradation caused by the organism and… Fig 4.
0.071730 - Graph of food’s height loss due to the degradation caused by the organism and food’s high gain due to the growing of the food over time.
0.090749 - Stopping criterion In the implemented method, we tried to integrate an automatic stopping criterion based on a threshold defined from the height of the food present in the environment.
0.079890 - For this purpose, while the organism moves in the environment, the heights of the foods are summed and compared with the sum of the heights in the input image, and the processing is finished as soon as at least 30% of the height of all foods has been eaten.
0.096296 - This threshold was defined experimentally for the images to be studied.
0.102981 - To test the efficiency of the proposed model, it was necessary to take images where it is possible to quantitatively measure the loss of contrast in the output image when compared with the ideal image, as well as the restoration rate obtained from the application of the proposed enhancement method.
0.100402 - For this purpose, 8 images were used for testing, where 4 grayscale images were synthetically created and the other 4 were real ones, including the traditional images “Lena” and “Cameramen”.
0.044539 - After that, each image was damaged twice, resulting in 16 grayscale images with changed contrast.
0.067183 - Both reduction contrast processes were applied over the original images, and in each of them a Gaussian noise was added with intensity equal to 0.3, and in one of these reduction contrast processes a circular median filter was applied with radius equal to 2 for blurring the image before applying the noise.
0.094828 - The results of the image enhancement obtained from the images with the contrast affected were visually and statistically analyzed based on the analysis of the indexes returned by PSNR (Peak Signal Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structutal Similarity) and Detail Variance and Background variance (DV-BV) metrics.
0.074074 - The PSNR and SSIM indexes were calculated comparing the original image and the images resulting from the controlled degradation process.
0.076453 - In addition, we analyzed the profile of a random line of the images, and compared the proposed method with other enhancement methods traditionally used in the spatial domain: normalization, histogram equalization, square enhancement, square root enhancement and logarithmic enhancement methods (Gonzalez & Woods, 2006).
0.098246 - Adopted evaluation metrics Generally, the comparison between two images is a natural task for the human visual system, but the realization of this same task for a computer system is more complex and not so natural.
0.062271 - However, there are many studies attempting to provide techniques able to compare images, including techniques to statistically compare the performance of image processing methods (Ramponi, Strobel, Mitra, & Yu, 1996; Wang, Bovik, Sheikh, & Simoncelli, 2004).
0.092573 - Analysis based on error The indexes of comparison based on error try to estimate the perceived error between the processed image and the original image to quantify the image degradation.
0.065728 - The techniques of this category have as their main disadvantage the fact that they can fail in cases where translations in the images happen.
0.074074 - For example, similar images where one of the objects has been displaced can be classified as distinct by this process.
0.114227 - Moreover, these indexes perform the comparison based on the variation of the intensities of the pixels in the images, and images with different types of distortion can have similar indexes (Wang et al., 2004).
0.082954 - Despite of that, the indexes based on error are often used to compare the quality of image enhancement (Ghita & Whelan, 2010; Hashemi et al., 2010; Shkvarko et al., 2011) and image smoothing (Chen et al., 2010; Jin & Yang, 2011) methods, due to their simplicity and the fact that these images are usually affected by a few displacements during the computational processing.
0.076813 - Some of the most known indexes based on error are the PSNR (Peak Signal Noise Ratio), RMS (Root Mean Square), MSE (Mean Squared Error) and ReErr (Relative Error) (Wang, Bovik, & Lu, 2002).
0.079321 - However, the most commonly used to analyze the performance of the restoration and enhancement methods is the PSNR, which attempts to calculate the relationship between the highest possible force strength of a signal (in the case of the image it is the highest intensity value) and its strength affected by noise (Dash, Sa, & Majhi, 2011; Yang, Wang, Xu, & Dai, 2009).
0.093584 - In this case, the PSNR is represented in function to a logarithmic scale on the base 10 (decibel), because some signals have a very high value.
0.074766 - The PSNR can be calculated from the MSE, which can be defined as: (3) where m and n are the dimensions of the input image, I is the original image, and Ir is the affected image by processing or by any artifact.
0.072464 - From the MSE index, the PSNR can be calculated as follows: (4) where MAXI is the maximum value that a pixel can be.
0.092199 - To the grayscale images represented by 8 bits, for example, MAXI = 255.
0.087432 - During the interpretation of the PSNR index, the higher its value, the more similar are the two compared images.
0.104478 - It is important to note that for identical images, the MSE index value will be zero, and thus the PSNR is undefined.
0.098872 - Analysis based on structural information This approach attempts to note the changes in the structural information of the image to quantify the occurred degradation.
0.061162 - The analysis of the structural information assumes that the human vision system is adapted for extracting structural information from what is seen, searching for changes in these structures to detect changes and consequently, possible degradation generated by some process (Wang et al., 2002).
0.120203 - The SSIM index (Structural Similarity) is an index of this class most often used to analyze the quality of computational methods for image processing (Chen et al., 2010; Zhang, Dong, Zhang, & Shi, 2010b).
0.099282 - The SSIM index was proposed by Wang and colleagues (Wang et al., 2004) in an attempt to avoid that the images with very different visual qualities have the same index, as can happen in the indexes based on error.
0.120010 - This index is calculated based on three components of comparison: luminance, contrast and image structure.
0.112994 - The first parameter is calculated from the average intensity of the signal, in this case the input image.
0.115556 - The contrast is calculated from the standard deviation, and the structure parameter is computed from the normalized image using the standard deviation of the same image.
0.090390 - So, the SSIM index can be obtained using the equation: (5) where, α > 0, β > 0 and γ > 0 are constant parameters used to define the weight of each component in the final index.
0.072727 - The component l refers to the luminance, c to the contrast and s to the structure.
0.090395 - The three components are relatively independent, and changes in one of them do not affect the other ones.
0.000000 - In Wang et al.
0.070175 - (2004) a more detailed analysis of each component is presented, showing in detail how they are calculated.
0.085627 - The SSIM value shows an index for each pixel of the image and, to make its use more practical, it is common to use a mean SSIM index, also called MSSIM, which is calculated from the average of the elements obtained from SSIM.
0.096220 - For equal images, this index is equal to 1 (one positive), being reduced as the images differ, reaching the value −1 (negative one) for two images exactly opposite (one image is the negative of the other one).

0.086758 - These values are calculated from the local variance of the n neighbors of all image pixels, creating a matrix of variances in a first step.
0.073746 - Afterwards, each pixel is classified into two classes: the variance of each pixel is compared to a threshold, and if it is greater than the threshold value, the pixel is classified as belonging to the image foreground, otherwise the pixel belongs to the image background.
0.086758 - After classifying all pixels of the image, the mean variance of the pixels belonging to two classes are calculated, and respectively called DV and BV.
0.080278 - To check the level of enhancement applied to the image, these two values are analyzed as follows: if the DV index of the processed image increases when it is compared to the DV index of the input image, while the BV value suffers a little change, it is considered that the image was efficiently enhanced.
