We also made a comparison with other artificial intelligence algorithms. The method allows classification with average value 0.98 of Az. The method is effective in 360 digitized mammograms from DDSM database.

0.063694 - Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women with ages of 40–55 years worldwide (Jemal, Siegel, Xu, & Ward, 2010).
0.034063 - Studies have shown that early detection is the key to improve breast cancer prognosis (Elter & Horsch, 2009).
0.056497 - Screen/film mammography is the most clinically accepted imaging modality to aid the radiologists in the early detection of occult breast cancers in asymptomatic women.
0.048246 - A number of important signs of breast cancer, which radiologists look for, are clusters of microcalcifications, masses, and architectural distortions.
0.041995 - Mass detection is a more complex task because it is frequently indistinguishable from adjacent tissues.
0.054289 - Mass detection poses a more difficult problem because it is often: (a) very pronounced in size, shape and density; (b) poor in image contrast; (c) highly connected to the surrounding parenchymal tissue density, particularly for speculated lesions and (d) surrounded by no uniform tissue background with similar characteristics (Hong & Sohn, 2010).
0.026144 - That makes progress to be considerably slow for mass detection.
0.058394 - As a result, detection sensitivity and specificity of screening mammography is not optimal (Fenton et al., 2006).
0.076433 - Second reading of the mammograms by a human reader can increase cancer detection rates (Thurfjell, Lernevall, & Taube, 1994; Warren & Duffy, 1995).
0.078189 - Obviously, this procedure is expensive and it is not a practical task in the clinical procedures of most countries around the world.
0.036281 - Hence, Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) have been applied as a second reader to assist radiologists when interpreting screening mammograms.
0.067863 - Because of the growing interest in applications for mammography, computerized texture analysis has been utilized to extract clinical meaningful information from various medical imaging modalities (Li et al., 2005).

0.074766 - The multiresolution analysis has proved to be useful in feature extraction.
0.045351 - The common task is to decompose the original image into sub-bands that preserve high and low frequency information.
0.081942 - Several studies have investigated the use of wavelet transform as multiresolution analysis tool for texture analysis and classification (Liu & Sako, 2006; Masotti, Lanconelli, & Campanini, 2009; Ramos, Nascimento, & Pereira, 2012).
0.031496 - When applied to images, wavelet transform produces a low resolution image and several detail images.
0.042463 - The low resolution image is obtained by iteratively blurring the image; the detail images contain the information lost during this operation.
0.026144 - These coefficients could be interpreted as inputs to a classifier.
0.067736 - The classifier is a tool that receives as inputs the values of the features extracted and provides as output the risk degree related to the available tissue.
0.067418 - The challenge is to define a classification algorithm that can provide the most appropriate response to the problem, being statistical, artificial intelligence, support vector machines, or polynomial methods commonly consider the prediction of the breast cancer pattern (Pendharkar, Rodger, Yaverbaum, Herman, & Benner, 1999, 2000; Ramirez-Villegas & Ramirez-Moreno, 2012).
0.066116 - Our decision for the polynomial classification was conditioned not only by its capacity of learning complex patterns that could be linearly inseparable, but also by the success reached in various applications of pattern recognition (Park, Oh, & Kim, 2008).
0.052083 - A polynomial classification is a parameterized nonlinear map which nonlinearly expands a sequence of input vectors to a higher dimension and maps them to a desired output sequence.
0.072562 - The purpose of this expansion is to improve the separation of the different classes in the expanded vector space.
0.064412 - The polynomial expanded vectors are used to define an ideal output sequence by minimizing a criterion function and we describe a strategy to define weights to separate classes considering algebraic values.
0.048780 - This strategy presents the advantages of providing only one model for optimal separation of classes and to consider this as the solution of the problem, which does not occur with the models presented in Campbell, Assaleh, and Broun (2002), Ajmera and Holambe (2010) and Park et al.
0.000000 - (2008).
0.137588 - Therefore, the proposed system consists of two major stages: texture analysis and lesion classification.
0.080808 - Multiresolution analysis features are extracted to focus the texture points in the region of interest (ROI).
0.059524 - In this study, each ROI is decomposed using the different wavelets separately.
0.016878 - For multiresolution analysis tools, these features were computed based on three different wavelet functions, Daubechies 8 (db8), Symlet 8 (sym8) and bi-orthogonal 3.7 (bior3.7) (Meselhy Eltoukhy, Faye, & Belhaouari Samir, 2010; Rashed, Ismail, & Zaki, 2007).
0.113095 - Then a set of the corresponding coefficients of each mammogram is extracted.
0.092105 - For feature selection and classifier we used the polynomial classification algorithm to define the ROI as normal, benign or malignant.
0.122421 - In this study, we also present a comparation with three classification algorithm (Decision Tree, SVM, and K-NN).
0.041995 - We chose those three algorithms because they have diverse characteristics (Zhang, Tomuro, Furst, & Raicu, 2012a).
0.102564 - A ROC curve is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.
0.098139 - This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2.1, we present a subset of mammography cases selected from a publicly available database, the Digital Database for Screening Mammography.
0.068027 - In Section 2.2, it is described the algorithm employed on feature extraction, computed with three different wavelet functions.

0.102573 - Block diagram of the proposed approach for classification of masses using multiresolution analysis features and polynomial classifier.
0.064171 - Data set The database used in this work encompasses mammographic screen/film digitized images taken from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) (Heath et al., 1998).
0.062893 - The DDSM project is a joint effort of researchers from the Massachusetts General Hospital (D. Kopans, R. Moore), the University of South Florida (K. Bowyer), and the Sandia National Laboratories (P. Kegelmeyer).
0.074238 - The DDSM database has been widely used as a benchmark for numerous articles on the mammographic area, for being free of charge and having a vast and diverse quantity of cases.
0.035915 - It is constituted of mammographic images and its corresponding technical and clinical information, including exam dates, age of patients, digitalization equipment (as well as resolution, number of rows, pixels per row and bits per pixel of the acquired images), lesion types (according to BI-RADS (2003)®), and existent pathologies.
0.073557 - The dataset is composed of 360 mammographic images in cranio-caudal (CC) view randomly selected from the DDSM database, where 120 were diagnosed as malignant (M), 120 as benign (B) and 120 as normal (N).
0.085470 - We selected digitized images with a Lumisys laser film scanner at 50 μm.
0.059448 - In these experiments only the images obtained by the Lumisys scanner were selected because of questions related to standardisation of resolution.
0.052288 - Each image has a resolution of 4096 gray level tones.
0.049938 - The location and size of a mass, when it exists, were taken from the code-chain of the.ics file available at the DDSM project and were used to automatically extract square sub-images called regions of interest (ROIs) from the original image.
0.089558 - ROIs of the group N were extracted from mammograms without the presence of lesions defined manually by specialist.
0.056142 - In mass CAD approaches, texture analysis is not always performed on the full ROI but often only on special regions within the ROI.
0.047377 - Therefore, the images used in the experiments were cuttings of size 128 × 128 pixels done in the sub-image, whose centers correspond to the centers of the presented abnormalities.
0.054983 - Some examples of ROIs are presented in Fig 2.
0.055556 - Some ROI samples from the dataset: Normal class ((a) A-0339, (b) A-0358),… Fig 2.
0.041868 - Some ROI samples from the dataset: Normal class ((a) A-0339, (b) A-0358), benign class ((c) B-3102, (d) B-3368) and malignant class ((e) C-0034, (f) C-0064).
0.043011 - Multiresolution analysis Image analysis in multiple scales allows image resolution to be changed so as to process as little data as possible by selecting relevant details for a given visual task (Mallat, 1996).
0.071301 - The basic idea of multiresolution analysis is to represent an image on several sub-images, from coarse to fine resolution, and analyze them in the frequency domain.
0.068127 - Broadly speaking, multiresolution allows for the zooming in or out on an image, when this is necessary.
0.046948 - When processing texture extraction algorithms, it is frequently necessary to measure texture features on neighborhoods of different sizes.
0.059028 - Once multiresolution analysis evaluate image properties over domains of varying sizes, its zooming capacity makes the process not to be affected by the size of the pixel neighborhood.
0.054155 - In this article, it is used wavelet multiresolution transforms for texture extraction.
0.046948 - The task is to decompose the original image into sub-bands that preserve high and low frequency information.
0.065574 - This process is made recursively by high-pass and low-pass filtering the image.
0.044974 - In Mallat (1999), Mallat proved that a DWT of a signal is equivalent to its decomposition on a series of high-pass and low-pass filter banks, followed by a downsampling of two samples, one bank for each desired resolution.
0.038929 - The low-pass filters outputs give the approximation coefficients and the high-pass filters outputs the details.
0.046990 - In respect to images (bidimensional signals), the DWT can be computed as given by Fig 3, which shows an image decomposition from the j-th level to the (j + 1)-th level of the DWT.
0.074766 - The coefficients cAj represents the pixel values of the original image.
0.081633 - Firstly, the image is passed through a pair of filters on each row, followed by a downsampling of 2.
0.049383 - The results are used as inputs of two filter banks, which are applied at the columns of the image, followed by downsampling.
0.052227 - Four sub-images are generated in this process: the approximation cAj+1, which represents the original image with a smaller resolution, and the details , , which represent the horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions, respectively.
0.000000 - Filter bank representing one DWT stage Fig 3.
0.000000 - Filter bank representing one DWT stage.
0.055556 - Nonlinearity and smoothing operators Implementation of discrete wavelet transformation involves linear convolution of images with coefficients of mean filter for the wavelet basis function considered (Selvan & Ramakrishnan, 2007).
0.065359 - However, linear convolution increases the size of sub-band images.
0.062678 - This causes distortions at boundaries of the image, when the image is reconstructed.
0.109904 - To overcome this problem, we applied the method proposed by Selvan and Ramakrishnan (2007) to make the sub-band coefficients less sensitive to local variations.
0.062706 - In this technique, each row and column of a Q × Q image is periodically extended by R/2 pixels on both sides, where R is the number of filter coefficients.
0.048110 - That results in a (Q + R) × (Q + R) image.
0.041152 - Addition of any value lower than R/2 will not yield the required core samples, after removing excess samples on the boundaries.
0.028169 - An addition of any value higher than R/2 will lead to more number of samples than required.
0.051282 - Hence, R/2 pixels are added on all four sides of the image.
0.083832 - Convolution of the (Q + R) × (Q + R) image with a filter of length R yields ((Q + R) + R − 1) samples in one dimension.
0.031250 - Out of these samples, core (Q + 2R − 1 − 2(R − 1)) = (Q + 1) samples are considered for decimation, which results in [(Q + 1)/2] core samples after decimation.
0.043912 - Hence, after one level of wavelet decomposition, a Q × Q image yields four (Q/2) × (Q/2) sub-bands, resulting in nonexpansive samples.
0.048662 - In this case, the coefficient matrices were adjusted to the size 64 × 64 for one decomposition level.
0.065574 - For two decompositon level, this method yieds sub-band matrices of size 32 × 32.
0.041667 - In order to make the sub-band coefficients less sensitive to local variations, nonlinearity and smoothing operators must be applied on wavelet transform coefficients, before extracting the parameters.
0.034453 - For nonlinearity and smoothing operations, the total energy of wavelet transformation coefficients in each sub-band was calculated using the Equation: (1) where Ei is the overall energy in the ith sub-band, wi(j, k) is the wavelet transformation coefficient at locations (j,k) in the ith sub-band, and P and Q are the number of rows and columns of the ith sub-band, respectively.
0.028986 - Here, parameters P and Q have similar values.
0.094387 - In the present work, we also consider 3 × 3 neighborhoods to calculate the average, and normalize the average, as proposed by Selvan and Ramakrishnan (2007).
0.040189 - At each location Li(j, k), the local energy was computed in a 3 × 3 neighborhood by: (2) where the local energies Li(j,k) were normalized by: (3) The central wavelet coefficient from the 3 × 3 neighborhood was then replaced by the corresponding normalized energy.
0.053528 - Fig 4 represents the process of wavelet decomposition for each ROI to obtain the wavelet tranform coefficients.
0.048110 - Ilustration Wavelet decomposition of a mammographic image Fig 4.
0.053640 - Ilustration Wavelet decomposition of a mammographic image.
0.046205 - This process produced 12,288 wavelet coefficients for the first decomposition (64 × 64 in 3 sub-images) and 3072 coefficients for the second decomposition (32 × 32 in 3 sub-images).
0.079812 - Gathering together all detail coefficients from the sub-bands resulted on a feature vector of 15,360 attributes.
0.037225 - For multiresolution analysis features, we used four different decomposition levels based on three different wavelet functions, Daubechies-8 (db8), Symlet 8 (sym8) and bi-orthogonal 3.7 (bior3.7).
0.043912 - The used levels of decomposition and wavelet functions are selected based on previous works (Meselhy Eltoukhy et al., 2010; Rashed et al., 2007).
0.067864 - Singular value decomposition In this work, the number of wavelet coefficients is very large and the estimation of model parameters is computationally demanding.
0.076437 - Singular value decomposition (SVD) based method is a very powerful mathematical tool which is mainly used here to reduce a large dataset to a dataset with significantly fewer values, still containing a large fraction of the variability present in the original data.
0.073883 - The SVD method is extraordinarily useful and has many applications such as data analysis, signal processing, pattern recognition and image compression (Pedrini & Schwartz, 2008).
0.060914 - It is a linear algebra tool that allows for the decomposition of a matrix into the product of three more simple matrices (Ramakrishnan & Selvan, 2007a, 2007b; Selvan & Ramakrishnan, 2007).
0.067682 - To explain the aplication of SVD based method, consider the matrix Ii with size P × Q, whose entries are the sub-band wavelet coefficients after the introduction of nonlinearity.
0.044254 - The application of the SVD based method decomposes matrix Ii into the product of three matrices given by: (4) where Ui, with size P × Q, and Vi, with size Q × Q, are orthogonal matrices whose columns are the eigenvectors of matrices and , respectively, and Si, with size Q × Q, is a diagonal matrix whose non-zero entries are the singular values (square roots of the eigenvalues) of matrix , defined by: (5) where σi are the non-zero singular values, with σ1 ⩾ σ2 ⩾ ⋯ ⩾ σQ.
0.058394 - Once the SVD is unique for each matrix, the singular values completely represents the sub-band images.
0.081218 - A method of truncation of the lower singular values, which is equivalent to a filter based approach, was applied to matrix Si for dimensionality reduction with images with noise.
0.083832 - In Selvan and Ramakrishnan (2007), the authors have shown that the effect of noise is more intense on singular values with lower magnitudes.
0.056604 - Therefore, the diagonal matrix can be truncated to a dimension K × K, where K is given empirically by: (6) where σn is the nth singular value and σ1 is its highest value.
0.063492 - Since the wavelet transform in this work was considered for 2 resolution levels, there are sub-band images with sizes 64 × 64 and 32 × 32, what leads to a different number of truncated singular values (different K) for each ROI.
0.077834 - Therefore, Eq (6) was used to get a value of Kr for each resolution level, and the overall K was obtained by averaging the number of truncated singular values.
0.089242 - Having defined the average value K, singular values were extracted from each of the eight wavelet sub-images, resulting in a feature vector of 6K elements representing texture characteristics of the original mammograms.
0.000000 - Classifier structure 2.4.1.
0.074074 - Discriminant function In order to obtain good separation between classes for the proposed algorithm, we used discriminant functions gi(x), i = 1,2, … , m, where m is the number of classes.
0.044893 - In this case, the features vector, defined by x = [x1 ⋯ xd]T, where d represents the number of features and T is the transpose operation, belongs to class ωi if (7) Thus, the classifier calculates m discriminant functions and selects in the group of functions the highest discriminant value.
0.063492 - In the classification procedure, when only two classes are employed, the classifier is named dichotomizer (Duda et al., 2001).
0.070485 - The most used technique in a dichotomizer procedure is defined with only one discriminant function g(x), given by: (8) Equation g(x) = 0 determines a decision surface that separates the classes ω1 and ω2.
0.035320 - Thus, the linear discriminant function g(x) can be described according to the following equation (9) where the parameters wi are the components of a weight vector w. Adding to Eq (9) the product of pairs of feature vector components x, it is obtained the quadratic discriminant function given below.
0.044917 - (10) Then, polynomial discriminant functions can be generalized by the following equation: (11) where a is an L-dimensional weight vector, pn(x) is an L-dimensional vector whose entries are arbitrary functions of x and n represents the order or degree of the polynomial function.
0.067634 - Polynomial classifier For the classification of different groups of images, the wavelet coefficients vectors were passed as inputs defined by x = [x1 ⋯ xd]T, and they were expanded in terms of the vector-based polynomial pn(x).
0.063260 - This process allowed for the mapping of an d-dimensional feature vector into an L-dimensional vector.
0.067736 - For example, given a two-dimensional input vector x = [x1x2]T, the elements of p2(x) result in parameters similar to those shown in Campbell et al.
0.052083 - (2002) (12) Therefore, the dimensionality of the expanded vector pn(x) can be expressed in terms of the polynomial order and the dimensionality of the input vector x.
0.051051 - Finally, the classifier output yi was obtained after a linear combination of the expanded vector pn(x) as (13) where ai is a coefficient vector of the polynomial discriminant function for the class ωi.
0.065574 - Note that the classifier output was not averaged as presented in Campbell et al.
0.058140 - (2002) and Ajmera and Holambe (2010), and it was not also applied the two optimal models proposed in Hassan, El-Tarhuni, and Assaleh (2010).
0.083333 - There are also differences to the model proposed in Park et al.
0.071429 - (2008) because we only use the polynomial classifier to solve the problem.
0.058394 - The model was divided into two stages, namely training and testing, which are detailed in the sequel.
0.059748 - Training In the training phase, we used two input classes (m = 2) considering the following combinations of mammographic images: normal versus malignant (NxM), normal versus benign (NxB), and malignant versus benign (MxB).
0.074074 - The classes were identified as ω1 and ω2 for each combination of ROIs.
0.070620 - We also considered N samples {x1,x2, … , xN} of the d-dimensional space, with N1 being the number of samples of class ω1, N2 the number of samples of class ω2 and N = N1 + N2.
0.045884 - Thus, the N samples were used to determine the coefficients of the polynomial function in Eq (12), and the polynomial expansion for all features vectors were concatenated as: (14) Suppose the vector b = [b1b2 ⋯ bN] is the ideal output.
0.063613 - Therefore, there exists a solution in matrix form given by: (15) We must find an optimal weight vector a∗ that minimizes the mean-squared error criterion: (16) The minimum value of the criterion function can be calculated as: (17) 2.4.4.
0.067864 - Test In the test phase, a new feature vector v must be expanded in terms of the polynomial basis according to Eq (12).
0.046267 - We apply the inner product with the vector determined by Eq (17) and then define yi as the output: (18) Based on this result, we applied to v the class ωi according to the algebraic sign obtained, i.e., if yi > 0, vector belongs to the class ω1, otherwise, it belongs to ω2.
0.058140 - Performance evaluation The proposed algorithms were used to classify the objects from the sets M × N, B × N and M × B, as stated before.
0.057018 - We used each feature matrix obtained from the feature selection approach described earlier as the input data to the classifier.
0.095808 - We then employed a 10-time 10-folded cross-validation method to evaluate the proposed classifier accuracy as well as its generalization capability.
0.060264 - In this experiment, the feature vectors were divided into 10 disjoint groups containing 90% of the data for training and the remaining 10% for validation.
0.012461 - This process is repeated 10 times (Moayedi, Azimifar, Boostani, & Katebi, 2010).
0.072111 - In the application of the 10-fold cross-validation, the groups of data used in the training and testing procedure were randomly defined.
0.071856 - The overall performance of the algorithms can be evaluated by means of examining the ROC area index, Az, over the testing output values.
0.141912 - In this work, we also present a comparison with three classification algorithm (Decision Tree, SVM, and K-NN).
0.049938 - These algorithms were chosen for their distinct characteristics, e.g., Decision Tree is based on information gain; SVM are known to be robust to noise; K-NN decides the classification based on local information, as described in Zhang, Tomuro, Furst, and Raicu (2012b).
0.072562 - The experiments have also been conducted using 10-fold cross-validation for the classification based on the polynomial classifier.
0.058608 - The results are presented in Tables 1–3 for diferents classes of ROIs using the Biorthogonal 3.7, Daubechies 8 and Symlet 8 wavelet functions, respectively.
0.076389 - In these tables, we show the confusion matrices for each wavelet function, with the notations true-positive (TP), false-negative (FN), false-postive (FP) and true-negative (TN).
