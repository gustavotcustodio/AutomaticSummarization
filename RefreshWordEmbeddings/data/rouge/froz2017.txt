0.037634 - Cancer is an uncontrolled growth of cells in a specific region of the body.
0.060606 - Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate after diagnosis because of its late detection and treatment (Wood et al., 2012).
0.035794 - The high mortality rate is associated with its late diagnosis, which normally occurs at advanced stages of the disease.
0.091869 - The presence of lung nodules suggests cancer and indicates the stage of the disease.
0.069444 - The detection of nodules is essential to patient prognosis and an early diagnosis increases the chance of survival.
0.042553 - Additionally, increased information increases the precision of diagnosis.
0.068966 - Interest in the development and use of digital image processing techniques applied to CT, with the goal of enhancing diagnosis precision, has increased recently.
0.043393 - The combination of these techniques has led to the development of computer-aided detection (CAD)/computer-aided diagnostic systems (Polakowski et al., 1997).
0.081913 - A CAD system typically consists of four stages: 1) image acquisition; 2) segmentation of nodule candidates; 3) extraction of features from the candidates; and 4) reduction of false positives (classification into nodules and non-nodules).
0.061162 - All stages are fundamental to the success of a CAD system.
0.079511 - In this work, we examine the feature extraction and classification stages.
0.067183 - In these stages, we obtain the necessary information to reduce the number of false results.
0.053640 - In CAD methodologies, the feature extraction stage depends on: 1) geometry (for example, how round the candidate is); and 2) texture (grey level distribution).
0.028369 - In this work, we only use texture features.
0.111802 - The goal of this work is to analyze lung nodules, classifying the candidates into nodules or non-nodules.

0.117444 - The first technique uses an artificial life model, called artificial crawlers.
0.070738 - The curves extracted from it use the candidate CT scans as environments.
0.097825 - The second technique uses gradient vectors to extract texture features from the candidates based on a circular histogram called the rose diagram.
0.107518 - The third technique is a hybrid model that combines the texture features extracted from the other two methods.

0.064103 - In Section 6, we report the conclusions of this work.
0.048859 - As previously explained, a lung nodule detection system is commonly divided into several steps.
0.038462 - Each of these steps has its own challenges to overcome.
0.045855 - In nodule segmentation, one of the biggest difficulties is in isolating the nodule when connected with a vessel (juxtavascular) or with pleura (juxtapleural), without loss of texture.
0.064677 - With such losses, the whole system can be prejudiced, leading to wrong conclusions about the nodules.
0.043011 - After segmentation, wrong candidates to be nodules may be generated, known as false positives.
0.050420 - One big challenge is to reduce the false positives without losing actual nodules.
0.055866 - Determining which measurements of texture and/or form should be used in combination with a computational intelligence system is the main difficulty of any system.

0.126744 - This section describes the techniques used in the feature extraction step of both the artificial crawlers and the rose diagram.
0.079459 - Artificial crawlers Artificial Life are models that imitate life in nature Langton (1989).
0.056437 - The individuals that compose these models attempt to behave in similar ways to real organisms, and their behaviours, actions and lifespan are abstracted in a logical form.
0.087033 - Based on the Artificial Life concept, evolutionary algorithms and ACs were originally designed as models that use two-dimensional images as the environment.
0.088999 - The individual, called the artificial crawler (AC), lives in the pixels of grey-level images (Zhang & Chen, 2004).
0.038369 - Throughout evolution, some actions (movement, improvement, competition, stability, survival and death) are observed in the AC individuals.
0.030581 - Spatially close individuals are labelled as participants of the identical colony.
0.044818 - The colonies, as well as the numbers of participants, change as evolution occurs.
0.035354 - Each AC has certain characteristics: t is the time or iterator of the ACs algorithm, e(t) is the energy of the individual in time t; δ(t) is the colony the individual belongs to in time t; and β(t) is the location
0.055227 - They move to the nearest pixel with the highest intensity (local maximum) as they absorb energy from the environment to achieve this goal.
0.032258 - The higher the intensity of the pixel, the greater the amount of energy absorbed.
0.026936 - There are seven rules that the ACs must follow.
0.046296 - The rules are applied to every time t until the end of the cycle for every AC i.
0.000000 - ∀i, .
0.042553 - The initial value of every AC is e0.
0.000000 - ∀i, t, if ei(t) < emin, then ACi dies.
0.037037 - At each cycle, if the energy of any AC is less than a minimum value emin, it dies.
0.074906 - The AC is removed from the image.
0.000000 - ∀i: ei(t) ≥ emin, .
0.047962 - At each time t, the ACs will move according to three possible conditions, presented in Eq (1).
0.024353 - (1) (a) If the maximum pixel intensity of the 8-pixel neigbourhood of βi(t) of the AC i is lower than the pixel intensity of βi(t), the AC does not move.
0.031898 - (b) If the maximum pixel intensity of the 8-pixel neigbourhood of βi(t) of the AC i is higher than the pixel intensity of βi(t) and it is unique
0.031153 - (c) If the maximum pixel intensity of the 8-pixel neigbourhood of βi(t) of the AC i is higher than the pixel intensity of βi(t) and it is not unique
0.000000 - ∀i: ei(t) ≥ emin, .
0.010336 - When an AC i moves, it will lose one unit of energy defined by emin.
0.036036 - ∀i, j: and dies.
0.037244 - When ACs i and j occupy the same location at the same time, the one with the higher energy survives and the other one dies.
0.000000 - ∀i, .
0.027778 - The AC i absorbs λ percent of the pixel intensity it lies in at time t, if it moved.
0.000000 - This amount is converted into energy.
0.000000 - ∀i, j: ei(t) ≥ emax, .
0.024465 - The maximum energy the ACs can retain is defined as emax.
0.051282 - The rules are applied to all ACs at all times.
0.070175 - We can observe the state of emergency and balance of the population.
0.019900 - With evolution, no individual will die or regroup in a colony (emergency) at a certain time.
0.033573 - Certain ACs will move to areas of high intensity to absorb energy, losing a unit simultaneously (balance).
0.074906 - The result is a state of balance.
0.057554 - By recording the steps taken in the evolution of the ACs, we can later extract useful information.
0.058480 - The numbers of iterations and colonies in the ACs algorithm reach equilibrium.
0.041344 - These properties characterize the texture features of the environment through a series of evolution curves.
0.039801 - The curves are: agent evolution, inhabitant settlement, colony formation and scale distribution (Zhang et al., 2013).
0.036697 - The agent evolution curve represents the number of ACs per epoch.
0.041237 - The number of ACs drops at each iteration because of the depletion of energy, and depends on the placement of valleys and peaks of intensity in the environment.
0.046784 - The second curve, inhabitant settlement, is similar to the agent evolution curve.
0.040404 - It represents the number of extant ACs per iteration.
0.037037 - The curve of colony formation depicts the number of colonies formed by elements within a radius of distance.
0.046512 - The increment of the radius size results in fewer colonies with more individuals per colony.
0.033613 - The scale distribution depicts the statistical representation of the colonies at different scales.
0.029963 - Different textures lead to varied scale distributions.
0.000000 - This curve is an important technique for discerning texture.
0.065078 - Rose diagram The RD is a circular histogram with bars that represent sectors (Mardia & Jupp, 2009).
0.064103 - The RD resembles a flower, and the sectors resemble petals.
0.047962 - The number of sectors in the RD is determined by the user and the group angle intervals.
0.064103 - The RD extracts information based on angular features of objects.
0.025641 - Many directional measurements, such as local gradients, can be used.
0.051680 - The Sobel filter is commonly used to calculate the gradients (Lee, Seo, Ryoo, & Yoon, 2010a).
0.067896 - Some features may be extracted using the Sobel gradients (Mardia, 1972).

0.079946 - Image acquisition The lung images used in this work are available in the public database LIDC-IRDI (Armato et al., 2011).
0.052758 - Some principles, such as identity protection, patient consent and lung cancer diagnosis, are defined by the publisher.
0.064327 - The database contains 1012 CT scan series and 290 radiography scan series.
0.059140 - Each image contains information regarding the nodules, such as location, size, quantity and malignancy.
0.049751 - The scans are diagnosed by four specialists and all diagnostics are indicated in the auxiliary files.
0.067227 - Some scans contain conflicting information between the image header and the auxiliary files.
0.091869 - Therefore, only 833 CT scans were chosen to be part of the candidate database.
0.124494 - The images are divided into two databases: nodule and non-nodule candidates.
0.121019 - A CT scan, provided by the LIDC-IRDI database, contains lung nodules markers from the four specialists.
0.051282 - The scan may have one or more nodules marked individually.
0.044944 - Sometimes the specialists disagree on the diagnosis.
0.062640 - These markers contain the coordinates and the slices of the 3D CT exam in which the nodules are found.
0.093567 - The size of the nodule varies from 3 mm to 30 mm.
0.040968 - The database does contain nodule markers that are less than 3 mm, but they are represented by a single coordinate, not by a bounding box.
0.026936 - These smaller nodules are not included in this work.
0.056022 - Fig 2 depicts some examples of nodule candidates used in the proposed methodology.
0.000000 - Fig 2.
0.033755 - 2D view of nodule candidates.
0.026936 - We utilize all regions marked by specialists as nodules.
0.060606 - For example, if the image has four markings, we use them in the training and test as four distinct nodules.
0.053872 - The idea is to use all the specialist expertise.
0.104662 - The non-nodule candidates were extracted from the methodology described by Carvalho Filho et al.
0.000000 - (2014).
0.161471 - Their work uses the quality threshold algorithm followed by a growing region to segment lung nodule and non-nodule candidates from the LIDC-IRDI database.
0.084015 - We used non-nodule candidates from Carvalho Filho et al.
0.015873 - (2014) because their work is consistent.
0.084978 - Non-nodules are excluded from the detection step and can be reused in the proposed methodology.
0.088572 - Their nodule candidate database is not employed in the present work because the database is small (and may thus result in misclassification) compared to the specialist markers from LIDC-IRDI.
0.057582 - Fig 3 demonstrates examples of non-nodule candidates.
0.020833 - Fig 3.
0.056628 - 2D view of non-nodule candidates.
0.051282 - Feature extraction The extraction of features occurs in this phase.
0.014184 - This is a necessary step for posterior classification.
0.074074 - The proposed methodology uses three techniques for feature extraction.
0.053640 - The first one is the ACs model, the second is the RD model, and the third combines features from the ACs and the RD.
0.076862 - Directional texture (the rose diagram model) exploits the advantages of both the directional and the intensity information in the images (Rivera, Castillo, & Chae, 2015).
0.046901 - Analyzing that information in a local neighbourhood diminishes the influence of noise in the feature extraction because the gradient works with the edges, regardless of single pixel intensity variation.
0.078704 - The use of artificial life concept in image classification resulted in promising results by Zhang and Chen (2004).
0.047962 - The ACs method provided high level statistical features that represent consistencies in the textures of the images.
0.032051 - Both techniques utilize different types of analyses inside the texture.
0.069652 - If used together, they may reduce weaknesses and the classifier has the advantages of both methods.
0.112501 - Artificial crawlers The ACs model and the steps necessary to extract the feature vectors are presented in Fig 4.
0.000000 - Fig 4.
0.048309 - ACs model diagram.
0.102418 - Step 1 uses both nodule and non-nodule candidates and retrieves the corresponding evolutionary curves from the ACs algorithm for all images.
0.048780 - In step 2, the templates are chosen to aid in posterior feature extraction, which is based on the differences between the curves.
0.067183 - The templates of nodule candidates are the CT scans that best represent the entire database.
0.047101 - The more similar the curves of the nodule templates are to the candidate analyzed, the higher the probability of the candidate belonging to the nodule class.
0.046122 - Step 3 uses the differences between the candidates and the template curves and the area under the candidate curves as features.
0.063315 - Step 1: The extraction of the evolutionary curves (the ACs algorithm is applied to every candidate from the two separate databases) generates four evolutionary curves.
0.086022 - We added some modifications to the ACs method developed by Zhang and Chen (2004).
0.095238 - We adapted the ACs to CT scans because they are 3-dimensional images.
0.048930 - ACs individuals may move in the x, y and z axes.
0.032258 - The ACs perceive the 26-neighbourhood space instead of the previous 8-neighbourhood plane.
0.053872 - Fig 5 demonstrates the AC adaptation for this work.
0.000000 - Fig 5.
0.000000 - An AC’s perceived neighbourhood.
0.028369 - The black cube is the AC’s voxel.
0.029963 - The transparent cubes are the neighbourhood voxels.
0.064103 - (a) 2D 8-pixel neighbourhood from Zhang and Chen (2004).
0.044944 - (b) The proposed 3D 26-pixel neighbourhood.
0.030651 - The new ACs assign the number of initial ACs using the voxels not in the background as the location for the new-born individuals.
0.053872 - The old ACs approach assigns random positions to individuals.
0.082818 - This approach is not effective for lung nodule and non-nodule candidate images because elements born in background voxels will not interact with texture variations.
0.062016 - Individuals will be isolated and the curve extraction will contain irrelevant information regarding the environment.
0.051680 - We can observe the behaviour of each candidate curve at the end of the extraction.
0.084015 - Fig 6 depicts the curves extracted from one nodule candidate.
0.000000 - Fig 6.
0.072501 - Curves extracted from one nodule candidate.
0.010753 - Step 2: In this step, one or more nodule candidates are chosen as templates.
0.059701 - Templates represent the entire nodule candidate database for further comparison between the templates and other candidates.
0.069444 - We choose templates only from the nodule candidates because of the inferior number of candidates in this database.
0.054726 - It is easier to find elements that best represent the entire set using a smaller base.
0.067061 - The nodule candidate database contains extra information regarding the size of the nodules, which is used to facilitate the choice of the template.
0.065359 - We chose three templates (3 mm to 10 mm, 11 mm to 20 mm and 21 mm to 30 mm) because of the variation in the size of the nodules.
0.040404 - After choosing the template, the evolutionary curves are extracted.
0.033670 - Step 3: The final step creates the feature vector.
0.040968 - With the evolutionary curves of the candidates and the templates obtained, the features are calculated in two ways: curve differences and area under the curve.
0.043011 - The curve distance will calculate the similarity between all candidates and all templates individually.
0.043290 - The sizes of the images in the database are different because of the diversity of the candidates in the samples.
0.056848 - This diversity may lead the ACs algorithm to create a variable number of initial ACs.
0.037037 - The distance between curves may vary too much, even when curves acquired from similar textures have identical behaviour.
0.051282 - The candidate curves are normalized between 0 and 1 in the y-axis (maintaining the shape of the curves) to reduce this inconvenience.
0.031898 - The distances used are the Euclidean (Danielsson, 1980), Jaccard (Shameem & Ferdous, 2009), simple matching (Paragios, Rousson, & Ramesh, 2002), Chebyshev (Klove, Lin, Tsai, & Tzeng, 2010) and Manhattan (Chang, Desoky, Ouyang, & Rouchka, 2009).
0.043011 - For each template, the five distances are calculated and put into the features vector.
0.031008 - The area under the evolutionary curve of each candidate is included in the feature vector.
0.090150 - Features from rose diagram model The RD model is presented in Fig 7.
0.108961 - The model contains the method diagram and the steps necessary to extract the feature vector.
0.000000 - Fig 7.
0.048309 - RD model diagram.
0.055866 - In step 1, the Sobel filter is applied to every candidate, generating the derivatives Gx and Gy, a pair (Gx, Gy) for each candidate image.
0.041344 - These pairs of derivatives are used in step 2 for the computation of the gradients.
0.058700 - The Sobel gradients are analyzed through the RD perspective in order to extract the features and to create the feature vector.
0.051282 - Step 1: The Sobel filter is applied to the candidates.
0.011204 - One pair of derivatives (Gx,Gy) is obtained for each candidate (Fig 8).
0.108961 - The model contains the method diagram and the steps necessary to extract the feature vector.
0.000000 - Fig 8.
0.042553 - Sobel filter applied to one nodule candidate slice.
0.051282 - (a) The original image (b) Gx derivative (c) Gy derivative.
0.028777 - This operation is executed in every slice of a candidate because it is a two-dimensional method.
0.036697 - The gradients are grouped together into a single RD per candidate.
0.043290 - Step 2: The Sobel gradients are computed for every pair of derivatives (Gx,Gy) in all non-background image pixels.
0.030303 - There is no texture variation in background pixels, so it is irrelevant to use the gradient information at these locations.
0.056848 - Step 3: The last step uses all gradients and creates one RD perspective per candidate.
0.062350 - Fig 9 depicts one RD from the gradients computed from the identical nodule candidate to Fig 8a.
0.052846 - The following features are calculated from the populated RD: mean direction, circular variance, circular standard variation, mean resulting length, kurtosis and skewness.
0.028369 - These calculations are entered into the feature vector.
0.000000 - Fig 9.
0.044944 - RD of a nodule candidate (Fig 8a).
0.120166 - Features from hybrid model The hybrid model is composed of the ACs and RD models.
0.051948 - It results in one feature vector which is a combination of the feature vectors produced by the other two models.
0.106765 - Fig 10 depicts the hybrid model scheme.
0.000000 - Fig 10.
0.109555 - Hybrid model diagram.
0.070175 - Table 2 summarizes all features present in the ACs and RD models.
0.097717 - These features will be combined into a single feature vector in the hybrid model.

0.096780 - Classification The nodule and non-nodule candidates are treated as two separate classes.
0.069652 - We used the support vector machine (SVM) classifier with the features extracted in Section 4.2.
0.031008 - SVM is a group of supervised learning algorithms used for classification or regression Joachims (1998).
0.042553 - It is straightforward to change kernels with SVM.
0.040404 - This property allows the description of complex data relationships.
0.042146 - An implemented version of SVM, the open source library LIBSVM (Chang & Lin, 2011), is used in this work through the tool Weka 3.6.
0.037736 - The chosen kernel is the RBF, and the parameters c and γ are estimated using the grid search algorithm (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012).
0.043011 - Validation The last phase demonstrates the consistency of the methodology, measuring its predictive value.
0.040201 - It computes the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity (Fielding & Bell, 1997), variation coefficient of accuracy (Soliman, Abd Ellah, Abou-Elheggag, & Abd-Elmougod, 2011) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Bradley, 1997).
0.075269 - The entire database of candidate images is partitioned into two groups: training and test.
0.074074 - The features are extracted using the three proposed methods.
0.096154 - The results are evaluated and compared to other related works.
0.080893 - Database separation We used the LIDC-IDRI (Armato et al., 2011) image database which is available on the Internet as a result of the association between the Lung Image Database Consortium and the Image Database Resource Initiative.
0.043011 - All images are in DICOM format and have up to 16 bits per voxel.
0.080003 - The computed tomographies (CT) were acquired using various protocols, which complicates the detection of lung nodules.
0.067039 - In this database, each exam is assigned to a file containing information regarding the contour and features of each nodule, supplied by four specialist physicians.
0.048930 - The contour indicates the points (x,y,z) of the nodule.
0.029851 - The entire region inside the contour is taken into consideration during the evaluation by our methodology.
0.044693 - The features indicate the properties of the nodule, including: degree of difficulty at detection, calcification level, sphericity level, degree of spiculation and degree of malignancy.
0.044743 - However, this information is only valid for nodules with diameters larger than 3 mm and smaller than 30 mm.
0.046512 - For nodules smaller than 3 mm, the specialists indicate only the centre of the mass.
0.038462 - Regions larger than 30 mm are considered to be masses.
0.052434 - The LIDC-IDRI contains 1012 CT scans.
0.024465 - Some (179) scans contain two factors that make our methodology impossible.
0.064815 - The first factor is related to scans that have no nodules larger than or equal to 3 mm.
0.026936 - These files do not contain the properties cited above.
0.031558 - The second factor is related to divergences in the marking file, when it does not match the information contained in the DICOM header.
0.104593 - Therefore, we only applied the methodology to the remaining 833 scans.
0.093567 - We used the 833 scans as training and testing samples for classification.
0.084034 - We extracted 6415 nodule candidates from these scans based on the specialists’ markings.
0.033755 - From Carvalho Filho et al.
0.050490 - (2014), we retrieved 17,742 non-nodule candidates.
0.056687 - Even with nearly three times as many non-nodules as nodules, the SVM classifier is able to optimize the separation of these two datasets due to the distinct characteristics vectors between the two samples.
0.097859 - The candidate database was proportionally divided into training and testing subgroups.
0.029112 - Four types of proportions were used: 20% for training and 80% for testing, 40% for training and 60% for testing, 60% for training and 40% for testing and 80% for training and 20% for testing.
0.000000 - Each proportion is permuted five times.
0.024465 - There are five distinct distributions for the candidate training/testing proportions.
0.061625 - The goal of this approach is to demonstrate that the results are consistent.
0.038314 - All training/testing groups provide the mACC, the mSEN, the mSPC, the CAv and the mROC of the five distributions evaluated for each proportion.
0.067436 - Curves analysis The slope of the evolution curves extracted from the ACs method can be interpreted in several ways.
0.090664 - Fig 11 depicts two samples of slices, a nodule and a non-nodule.
0.084015 - We compare the curves extracted from these two sample slices.
0.000000 - Fig 11.
0.000000 - Sample slices.
0.106765 - (a) Nodule and (b) Non-nodule example.
0.035088 - The agent evolution curve illustrates the number of living ACs per iteration.
0.062350 - Curves with a steep initial downward trend represent the fast ascending of ACs to high intensity locations.
0.071560 - The non-nodules do not have a specific behaviour because there is no texture pattern related to high and low intensity.
0.048387 - However, the nodules normally display high densities in a few locations because of calcification.
0.057554 - Fig 12 shows a visual representation of this curve with the two sample slices from Fig 11.
0.000000 - Fig 12.
0.089055 - Comparison of non-nodule and nodule agent evolution curves.
0.062016 - The inhabitant settlement curve has a smooth behaviour, similar to the nodule agent evolution curve.
0.039801 - Images with locations of diffuse high intensity may have more deceased ACs for the initial cycles.
0.029963 - However, the number decreases in subsequent iterations.
0.038401 - This phenomenon is common for non-nodules.
0.036697 - Fig 13 demonstrates the behaviour of the curves in both cases.
0.000000 - Fig 13.
0.089055 - Comparison of non-nodule and nodule inhabitant settlement curves.
0.061303 - We can interpret the colonies with smaller radius as diffuse peaks with high intensities isolated and spatially distant through the texture of the image.
0.055475 - Curves with a high number of colonies with a small radius are found at the final process of ACs in non-nodule samples.
0.052758 - Fig 14 demonstrates this behaviour in comparison to the slope of the colony formation curve for nodules.
0.000000 - Fig 14.
0.089055 - Comparison of non-nodule and nodule colony formation curves.
0.078858 - The scale distribution of non-nodules is irregular.
0.033613 - There are large groups of ACs at the end of the ACs process.
0.050926 - This behaviour is uncommon in the scale distribution of nodules because few ACs remain close to one another.
0.039216 - This phenomenon is because of the low number of peaks with high intensity.
0.036697 - Fig 15 depicts the slope of both cases of scale distribution.
0.000000 - Fig 15.
0.089055 - Comparison of non-nodule and nodule scale distribution curves.
0.067278 - Tests The features are extracted using the three previously described methods.
0.053872 - The first extraction is provided by the ACs method.
0.111055 - The second extraction uses the RD method and the third extraction is performed using the hybrid model.
0.092199 - The classification was performed using the SVM classifier.
0.120205 - Each method was tested separately and the best results are compared to the literature and discussed.
0.063116 - The parameters estimated through the grid search technique to the RBF kernel of SVM were c equal to 512 and γ equal to 2.
0.075269 - The results of the ACs method for feature extraction are presented in Table 3.
0.071081 - The best result achieved by this method was with the proportion of 40% for training/60% for testing, with mACC of 93.4%, mSEN of 91.82%, mSPC of 93.9%, CAv of 1.67% and mROC of 0.909.

0.093284 - The best results were achieved in this approach with a proportion of 60% for training/40% for testing.
0.055723 - We report mACC of 94.3%, mSEN of 91.86%, mSPC of 94.78%, CAv of 1.61% and mROC of 0.922.

0.095923 - There was a notable discrepancy between the results obtained in tests between the AC and RD models.
0.079511 - However, the results were improved by the combination of these models.
0.064103 - The performances of the methods imply some very useful information.
0.053763 - The test cases separated by different proportions showed very similar results in each model.
0.065160 - That means the randomly chosen partitions are well balanced even with more non-nodules candidates than nodules candidates.
0.064103 - The RD method performs better on true negative rate (mSPC).
0.076628 - Its power to correctly designate true negatives candidates is clearly observed on Hybrid method, because in comparison to AC model, the mSPC was improved.
0.070175 - This is the main contribution of the RD features on Hybrid method.
0.150540 - The best results were achieved with the hybrid model with a training/testing proportion of 60%/40%.
0.107744 - The worst results were from the RD model tests.
0.136190 - The RD model approach is not able to classify lung nodules consistently.
0.062350 - However, the combination of the ACs and RD models is more reliable than the two models alone.
0.068255 - The best result for the mROC curve can be observed in Fig 16.
0.071588 - The mROC curve demonstrates the good performance of the hybrid method in comparison with the ACs and RD approaches.
0.023392 - Any increase in sensitivity will be accompanied by a decrease in specificity.
0.044743 - We observe that the optimal true positive rate is achieved near the lowest value of the false positive rate.
0.030581 - Fig 16. mROC curve visualization from 60%/40% training/testing results.
0.062640 - As can be observed from the hybrid mROC curve, the hybrid method performance benefits mainly from the ACs method.
0.067227 - However, the RD method also benefits the hybrid performance, although with less influence.
0.052846 - The reason for this is the adaptation of the SVM classifier with a radial basis in scenarios with characteristics of undetermined relevance.
0.038462 - The most beneficial features are also the most relevant ones.
0.078704 - So the classifier is responsible for using the relevant features of both methods to optimize the hybrid performance.
0.049217 - Tests of the methodology were implemented on an Intel i5-3230M CPU @2.60 GHz on-board personal computer.
0.049808 - The total average execution times of the extraction of features, training and testing steps were recorded and are presented in Tables 6 and 7.

0.040404 - The feature extraction is the most time-consuming stage.
0.064677 - The hybrid method is the most time-consuming because it combines the ACs and RD methods.
0.090909 - This stage uses the entire database to retrieve the necessary information for feature extraction and the classification for model evaluation.
0.081871 - This evaluation is performed using the SVM classifier and the extracted features.
0.050926 - The training stage can be performed only one time and is recorded in a file for later testing.
0.022409 - Table 7 reports the mean elapsed time, in seconds, for the testing stage.
0.031008 - This is the least time-consuming stage because it is performed on only one sample.
0.080460 - With the trained database, the feature extraction and the model testing (classification) are fast enough to fit in a CAD system with acceptable performance.
0.056022 - Comparison with related works Table 8 lists the results achieved in the literature.
0.078431 - These results can be compared to the results obtained using the proposed methodology.
0.078431 - The comparison is approximate because some works used different databases and test scenarios.

0.038462 - The only accurate comparison is with Carvalho Filho et al.
0.000000 - (2014).
0.085106 - Their methodology was evaluated with the identical conditions.
0.060606 - Compared to the work by Carvalho Filho et al.
0.037453 - (2014), our methodology achieved a smaller specificity.
0.074012 - It is less capable of correctly classifying the non-nodule cases.
0.060606 - Sensitivity measures the capability of correct classification in nodule cases (patients with the illness) and our methodology is more efficient.
0.076023 - Achieving a good balance between the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy is important.
0.038462 - This balance was not found in Carvalho Filho et al.
0.000000 - (2014).
0.065160 - It is preferable for the methodology to have the smallest number of errors in the cases with cancer.
0.055227 - Other works use smaller or proprietary databases, which reduces the reliability of the results in comparison to the results in the present study.
0.052910 - Inasmuch some works use different study cases, we implemented three classical techniques for texture analysis using our tests scenarios for a righteous comparison of the proposed method.
0.028986 - The first one is the Histogram, the second one is the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix and the last one is the Gray Level Run Lengths.
0.059925 - The results are presented on Table 9.

0.053872 - The proposed work demonstrates great potential with this comparison.
0.135987 - This work presented a method that uses ACs, RD and SVM for classifying lung nodules and non-nodules.
0.070100 - The tests performed with the hybrid model yielded 94.3% mean accuracy, 91.86% mean sensitivity, 94.78% mean specificity, 1.61% coefficient of variation of the accuracy and 0.922 mean area under the ROC curve.
0.084034 - These results were obtained using the proportion of 60% training and 40% testing.
0.106383 - Some adaptations were made to the ACs model.
0.058480 - The first adaptation enables the use of CT scans as the environment.
0.070922 - The original ACs methodology used only 2D images.
0.039801 - The other change is the elimination of the random factor in image location for newborn ACs.
0.089695 - In the RD model, the use of a Sobel gradient as directional data extracted from the texture of the candidates was designed.
0.081565 - The directional statistical measurements were extracted using this method.
0.089636 - The changes to the ACs model are the main contribution of this work.
0.079511 - These changes adapted the model for the classification of medical images.
0.062016 - Although the good results presented in this article, we believe this methodology can be improved.
0.048930 - For this purpose, we propose the following as future work: 1.
0.064103 - The methodology uses the original intensity values of the voxels.
0.061162 - However, related works use some techniques to accentuate the images qualities.
0.052758 - That means the classification results should improve if any pre-processing method fits well in the methodology.
0.083122 - The Rose Diagram method use fixed size for the sectors to extract the gradient features.
0.072351 - An adaptive way to choose the size of the sector may optimize the method result.
0.059611 - The templates used by AC method used the nodule size for defining the templates.
0.051282 - Several characteristics can be used to determining templates, i.e.
0.054054 - the nodules malignancy features.
0.047962 - This can embrace new opportunities for others classification goals, like the distinctions between benign and malign nodules.
0.086245 - There can be used related methods in the artificial life context.
0.071588 - Other evolutionary algorithms and genetic algorithms may be used to confront or support the AC method for better performance.
0.058179 - This approach may also be adapted for temporal series images of Cancer CT exams for recognize nodules and its behavior over time, a four-dimension analysis.
0.077519 - Both the ACs and RD methods were not widely used in the nodule classification problem.
0.082251 - The evaluation of both techniques, and the creation of a hybrid method represent an important contribution to the scientific community.
0.058374 - 1 Each rose diagram sector groups a range of angles.
0.044743 - The larger the range, the larger the size of each section, and the total number of sections is decreased.

[Frase 3] This work proposes a methodology to classify lung nodule and non-nodule using texture features.
[Frase 71] This method used a hybrid random forest algorithm to classify the lung nodules and non-nodules.
[Frase 21] We believe we contribute for the expert system field because 1) the adaption of the Artificial Crawlers and Rose Diagram methods as 3D texture descriptors is innovative and contains great potential; 2) we adapted and developed measurements from the 3D texture descriptors; and 3) the simplicity and discriminative power of the methodology can be extended to applications based on images with other contexts.
[Frase 465] The best results were achieved with the hybrid model with a training/testing proportion of 60%/40%.
