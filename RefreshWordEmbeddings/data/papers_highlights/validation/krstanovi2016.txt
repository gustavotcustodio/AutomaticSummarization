We propose the novel more efficient similarity measure between GMMs.
It is done by projecting GMMs from high dimensional to a lower dimensional space.
GMMs distance is reduced to the distance between lower dimensional euclidian vectors.
Greater discriminativity and lower computational cost is obtained.
We confirm our results on artificial and real experimental data.
