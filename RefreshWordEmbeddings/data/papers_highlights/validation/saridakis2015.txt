We implement a swarm intelligence mechanism to design optimal car lines.
We aim to optimize differentiation and commonality levels among models in the line.
Our mechanism utilizes stated preference data derived from a conjoint experiment.
A prototype system is also developed to facilitate managerial decision making.
Insights are provided into how new and existing car models must be combined.
