Real test images were used to perform thresholding using Otsuâ€™s method with a high level of thresholds.
The proposed hybrid is compared with DE, jDE, PSO, ABC, and CS.
Algorithms are compared based on PSNR and SSIM metrics.
Friedman and Wilcoxon statistical tests are used to show the performances.
Proposed hjDE shows superior performance in the quality of the results.
