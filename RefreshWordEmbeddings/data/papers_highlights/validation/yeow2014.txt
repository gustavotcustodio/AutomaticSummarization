We modeled the CBR technique of forensic autopsy report preparation.
The CBR model was coupled with Naïve Bayes learner for feature weight learning and also the outcome prediction.
Feature weight learning improves the CBR system accuracy.
The outcome prediction is improved with Naïve Bayes prediction.
