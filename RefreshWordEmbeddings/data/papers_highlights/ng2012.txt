A novel Hebbian based Rule Reduction (HeRR) neuro-fuzzy system is applied to intra/inter-patient ventilator control.
Two ICU care studies demonstrate the capability of HeRR in extracting the salient knowledge from training data.
Experimental results on the two studies show promising use of HeRR for artificial ventilation.
HeRR uses the Hebbian ordering to determine the significance of each rule.
An iterative tuning and reduction process is proposed to strike a trade-off between interpretability and accuracy.
