A narrative-based reasoning (NBR) algorithm is proposed.
The algorithm automatically processes unstructured narratives.
The algorithm infers useful knowledge for decision support.
High recall and precision are achieved in the reasoning of unstructured data.
High recall is achieved for the association analysis.
