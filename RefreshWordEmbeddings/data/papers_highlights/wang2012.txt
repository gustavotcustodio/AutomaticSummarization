A GCBR algorithm is proposed.
GCBR algorithm resolves decision with multiple objectives and hierarchical criteria.
GCBR is a recommender to provide cases for multiple decision-making stages.
GCBR is implemented using genetic algorithm to reduce the case evaluation effort.
Using GCBR for making travel-planning recommendations can reduce about 80% effort.
