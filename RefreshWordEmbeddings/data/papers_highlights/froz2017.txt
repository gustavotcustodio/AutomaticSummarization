We develop a methodology to classify lung nodule and non-nodules.
833 lung scans were extracted from LIDC-IRDI database.
Three methods used was artificial crawlers, rose diagram and hybrid model.
The artificial crawlers was adapted to work on 3D images.
The best result was achieved from hybrid model, with accuracy of 94,3%.
