The applicability of variable precision rough set model for clustering student suffering studies anxiety is presented.
The proposed technique is based on the mean of accuracy of approximation using variable precision of attributes.
The datasets are taken from a survey aimed to identify of studies anxiety sources among students at Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP).
The results shown that variable precision rough set model can be used to group student in each study’s anxiety.
The results may potentially contribute to give a recommendation to improve student’s academic performance.
