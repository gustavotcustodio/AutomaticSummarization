Newborn screening plans are a routine for newborn care.
We present a fuzzy inference system to support newborn screening.
It screens for 46 inborn errors of metabolism and takes as input up to 42 analytes.
It has been tested with two different types of samples from three distinct sources.
High accuracy on diagnosis is obtained in 98.7% less time than laboratory personnel.
