IR aims to find a geometric transformation between two or more images.
In the last decade, the application of EAs to IR has caused an outstanding interest.
We apply innovative population-based algorithms (ABC, BBO, and HS) to tackle IR.
We compare ABC, HS, and BBO against other state-of-the-art contributions in 3D IRs.
