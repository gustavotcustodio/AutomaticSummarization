High-tech equipment development cost prediction using hybrid intelligence of SVM and fmGA.
Manufacturing cost estimation for Macro, LOT, and Repair systems.
The SVM concerns with learning and curve fitting, while the fmGA focuses on optimization of minimal errors.
The ESIM is developed to achieve the fittest C and Î³ parameters with minimized prediction error.
