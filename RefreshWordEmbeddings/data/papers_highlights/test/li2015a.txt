A hybrid algorithm (PS–ABC) based on PSO and ABC is proposed.
PS–ABC examines the aging degree of pbest to decide which type of search phase.
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) serves as a local search phase.
Onlooker and modified scout bee from the ABC serves as two global search phases.
Our algorithm is effective in solving high-dimensional optimization problems.
