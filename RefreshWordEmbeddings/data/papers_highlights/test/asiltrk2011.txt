The surface roughness is measured during turning at different cutting parameters such as speed, feed, and depth of cut by full factorial experimental design.
Artificial neural networks (ANN) and multiple regression approaches are used to model the surface roughness of AISI 1040 steel.
The ANN model estimates the surface roughness with high accuracy compared to the multiple regression model.
