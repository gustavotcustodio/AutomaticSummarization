This paper studies of the performance of Ant Colony Extended to the Travelling Salesman Problem.
The algorithm includes two kinds of ants: patrollers (exploration search) and foragers (exploitation search).
The algorithm includes a population dynamics allows the algorithm to self-organise.
The algorithm is able to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem successfully compared with other classical ant algorithms.
