The cause, essence and interrelationship of sample degeneracy and impoverishment in the particle filter are analyzed.
Approaches that are effective in alleviating sample degeneracy and impoverishment is presented.
Approaches that are effective for dealing with high-dimensionality are reviewed.
A comprehensive survey of artificial intelligence algorithms and machine learning techniques applied in particle filters is presented.
A common principle to enhance the particle filter, termed as Particle Distribution Optimization (PDO), is established.
