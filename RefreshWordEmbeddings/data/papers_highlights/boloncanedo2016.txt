A proposal for online feature selection is proposed.
The proposed pipeline covers discretization, feature selection and classification.
Classical algorithms were modified to make them work online.
K-means discretizer, Chi-Square filter and Artificial Neural Networks were used.
Results show that classification error is decreasing, adapting to the arrival of new data.
