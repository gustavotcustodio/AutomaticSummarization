In this study we show heart rate variability which can be used as a passive means to quantify drowsiness. Frequency domain components of HRV is used for early detection of fatigue.
We also designed a neural network based artificial intelligent algorithm which detects whether the given HRV signal is in alert of fatigue state.
The frequency domain components of HRV were also used to distinguish between parasympathetic (HF) and sympathetic (LF) activities using LF/HF ratio. Statistical analysis was also performed to identify the difference between LF/HF ratio during alert and fatigue states.
