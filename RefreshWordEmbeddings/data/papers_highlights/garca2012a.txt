An SVM-based system to solve the allocation and discovery of new models is proposed.
The objective is to build groups of time series that share the same forecasting model.
For the identification of new models, the system as signs “virtual models”.
It groups a sample of more than 14,000 time series in around 70 categories.
Only 12 of them already group over 98% of the total.
