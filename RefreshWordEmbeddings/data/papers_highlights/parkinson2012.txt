We model the pseudo-static geometric errors of machine tools with both linear and rotary axes.
We explain how it is possible to measure multiple machine tool error components simultaneously.
One model is developed as a Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) that can plan measurements sequentially.
A second model is developed in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) that can plan for simultaneous measurements.
The models are then verified by comparing generated plans with those of academic and industrial experts.
