This research proposes functional networks data mining predictive model for the software development efforts.
Functional networks is a new intelligence paradigm that deals with generalized functional models instead of standard types and then the neuron functions associated with each neuron are not fixed but are learnt from the available data.
It is a problem-driven data mining predictive model, which means that the initial architecture is designed based on a problem in hand.
The results of this research indicate that functional networks learning scheme was competitive even better than both standard neural networks and multiple regression.
