Design and implementation of an AI-based fault locator are discussed.
Wavelet probabilistic neural network is utilized to detect the fault in generator.
This fault locator uses samples of magnetic flux linkages to reach a decision.
he designed AI-based locator takes into account all the practical limitations.
