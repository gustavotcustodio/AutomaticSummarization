This work aims to optimize time and effort required to supply raw material inside a manufacturing plant.
A standard time is established for distributing material from warehouse to production lines.
The study is treated as a combinatorial optimization problem.
Artificial bee colony algorithm is used for finding the best answer.
Metaheuristics can be used to improve processes in the manufacturing industry of Mexico.
