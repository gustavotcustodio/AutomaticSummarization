The physico-chemical properties and heavy metals in environmental materials from the Niger Delta area were assessed.
The SOM was used as a powerful visualization tool to identify trends in the dataset.
Preliminary diagnoses of the quality of locational environmental materials are effectively carried out using the SOM algorithm to develop the c-planes.
Areas with high concentrations of pollutants were easily identified from the c-planes.
These stations from the Niger Delta should be classified as high priority sites.
