I modeled an intelligent novel vision-based robotic tracking system which developed to predict the performance of human trajectories.
I examined to learn trajectory data of information about vision-based robot.
The learned information to find out road will increase performance of mobile robot.
Besides, the learned information by sensors on robot will provide the robotâ€™s interaction with the environment.
