This paper identifies the computational intelligence of breast cancer.
The best suited algorithms for early breast cancer detection is identified.
The imbalanced nature of the data is considered and SMOTE is used.
Microarray and image data are used in this research.
This research indicates SMO as the most potential candidate.
