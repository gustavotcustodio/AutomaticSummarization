An insight to the application of computational intelligence to mass soldering is given.
Applications of computational intelligence (CI) have expanded rapidly in the industry.
The methods used mostly in mass soldering are neural networks and fuzzy sets.
Multilayer perceptrons have been the mostly used type of artificial neural network.
The main application field has been the inspection of soldered joints.
