RST-PSO- BPNN algorithm based on computational intelligence techniques is presented.
RST-PSO- BPNN can solve the multifactor highway passenger volume prediction problem.
PSO can optimize the structure and parameters of the back propagation neural network.
RST is used to act as the pre-treatment cell of ANN and mine knowledge.
