We have developed a middleware to integrate heterogeneous sensors and devices found in the market, and provide an abstraction layer for Ambient Intelligence applications.
By using W3C standards for description and discovery (for the Broker subsystem), the middleware provides interoperability even outside the borders of the system.
A large-scale deployment of wireless sensors, devices and servers running the middleware has been set up at a Smart University setting.
Web, Desktop and Mobile clients have been developed on the application layer, and enable energy savings through monitoring.
Server tests have been carried out on PCs, netbooks and board computers to ensure minimum energy consumption and compactness of the platform, without compromising performance.
