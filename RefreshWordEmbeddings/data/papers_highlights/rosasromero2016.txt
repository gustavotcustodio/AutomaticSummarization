A new predictive model for time series within the financial sector is presented.
The method is based on learned redundant dictionaries for sparse representation of financial time series.
The overall return gain generated by the predictive model exceeds the gain generated by the market.
Untrained dictionaries outperform dictionaries trained with the KSV-D method.
Untrained dictionaries require a reduced number of atoms to achieve successful results.
