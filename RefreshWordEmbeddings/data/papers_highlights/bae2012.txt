This paper analyzed the yearly financial data of manufacturing corporations collected by the KODIT.
We developed a financial distress prediction model based on radial basis function SVM.
We compare the classification accuracy performance between our RSVM and AI techniques.
The experiments demonstrate that RSVM always outperforms other models in the performance of financial distress predicting.
This enhancement in predictability of future financial distress can significantly contribute to the correct valuation of a company.
