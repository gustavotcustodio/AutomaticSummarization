We developed mathematical model for three echelon supply chain network model.
We used four PSO Variants for the performance analysis of supply chain network.
We applied particle swarm intelligence algorithms in supply chain network architecture optimization.
We have compared computational efforts and solutions obtained by the PSO variants.
PSO algorithm works like DSS for supply chain managers.
