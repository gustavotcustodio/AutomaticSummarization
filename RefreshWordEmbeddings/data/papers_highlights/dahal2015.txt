Deployment of PMUs in grid has brought a new data stream to be processed.
New method of stream processing is proposed to improve awareness in power systems.
Phasor data stream is mined to minimize wide spread outages and cascading failures.
Synchrophasor data is processed within acceptable time, memory, and accuracy.
Operators can be alerted quickly to improve the future power systemsâ€™ reliability.
