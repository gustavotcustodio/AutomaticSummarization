We introduced several methods of pattern password authentication for touchscreens.
We designed a touchscreen user interface and we collected touch durations.
As the classifier algorithms we used ANN, ANFIS and RGB Histogram methods.
80 real attempts and 80 fraud attempts from 10 users are operated.
We achieved EER of 8.75% for ANN, 2.5% for ANFIS, 7.5% for RGB Histogram.
