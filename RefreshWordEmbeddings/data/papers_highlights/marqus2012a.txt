We introduce composite ensembles that jointly use different strategies for diversity induction in credit scoring applications.
The combination of bagging and AdaBoost with random subspace and rotation forest for the construction of two-level ensembles is explored.
The jointly use of bagging and rotation forest in any order performs better than the other combinations.
