We apply Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) to optimize numerous numerical test functions.
The numerical experiments performed on well-known benchmark functions.
The obtained results are compared with the up-to-date metaheuristic algorithms.
BCO can generate high-quality solutions within negligible CPU times.
The BCO is competitive with other methods.
