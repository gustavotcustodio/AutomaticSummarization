Accurately predicting fabricating cost in a timely manner can enhance corporate competitiveness .
This study employs the Evolutionary Support Vector Machine Inference Model ( ESIM ) to predict the cost of manufacturing thin-film transistor liquid–crystal display ( TFT-LCD ) equipment .
The ESIM is a hybrid model integrating a support vector machine ( SVM ) with a fast messy genetic algorithm ( fmGA ) .
The SVM concerns primarily with learning and curve fitting , while the fmGA is focuses on optimization of minimal errors .
Recently completed equipment development projects are utilized to assess prediction performance .
The ESIM is developed to achieve the fittest C and γ parameters with minimized prediction error when used for cost estimate during conceptual stages .
This study describes an actionable knowledge-discovery process using real-world data for high-tech equipment manufacturing industries .
Analytical results demonstrate that the ESIM can predict the costs of manufacturing TFT-LCD fabrication equipment with sufficient accuracy .
Retail prices of thin-film transistor liquid–crystal displays ( TFT-LCDs ) are strongly influenced by the high degree of research and development ( R & D ) uncertainty .
In practice , the functions and specifications of a flat panel can not be fully determined during early R & D stages ; thus , initial cost estimation ( ICE ) is largely based on the subjective judgment of experienced engineers .
Such an ICE is only a price quoted for potential buyers and a comparative estimate for potential providers .
Although knowledgeable sales managers or estimators may generate accurate cost assessments via teamwork , professionals are difficult to train and very mobile in small and medium-sized enterprises in Taiwan .
Thus , experience and project knowledge is difficult to retain , resulting in such problems as loss of project know-how .
The TFT-LCD industry in Taiwan , which is promoted by the government ’ s Two Trillion Twin Stars plan , has developed rapidly in recent years .
The TFT-LCD industry is second only to the semiconductor industry in driving Taiwan ’ s economic growth .
Notably , LCD production involves hundreds of complex processes .
Each panel manufacturer typically has patented processes and production lines requiring highly customized manufacturing equipment .
Producing various panel sizes is typical as the need for next-generation panels increases .
Despite significant advances in tools and techniques assisting in project management ( PMI , 2004 ) , project managers ( PMs ) in the engineer-to-order manufacturing industry still encounter problems associated with guesswork and subjective judgment that result frequently in inaccurate estimates .
These non-objective approaches result in several important difficulties that render them inadequate for general application .
Notably , companies can lose market share and orders during the early marketing phase of attracting customers as a result of inefficient and inaccurate cost estimation .
Although human experts can achieve a satisfactory outcome , shortfalls typically occur as managers fail to access relevant information efficiently .
Generally , shortcomings in a currently used subjective-assessment or analogous method suggest a need and opportunity for improvement .
Development of a deterministic mathematical model to solve project cost management problems is both difficult and expensive .
Approximate inference , a fast and cost effective approach , is a viable alternative to a deterministic mathematical model .
Inference is the process of deriving new knowledge from known information .
When the known information changes , the inference process adapts accordingly .
Cost prediction problems are complex and full of uncertainties , vagueness and incomplete or inexact data .
Therefore , the inference process must fit environmental realities ( Mareels & Polderman , 1996 ) .
Humans can learn and process complex problems , even when faced with uncertainty , imprecision , and incomplete information .
Imitating the human inference process is an effective approach to solving cost management problems .
The technological marketplace has become increasingly competitive due to rapid globalization .
Product cost estimation is thus critical for sales managers at companies developing high-tech equipment to gain competitive advantage .
As the amount of time panel manufacturers allocate to investment and production is critical , fast and accurate estimations are essential to successful delivery of devices to markets in a timely manner , as is quality to customers in increasingly competitive markets .
Although many studies of the TFT-LCD industry have analyzed raw materials , processes , supply chains , and marketing , cost forecasting of TFT-LCD fabrication equipment has seldom been addressed .
The primary objective of this research is to accurately predict the costs of high-tech manufacturing equipment .
This study reviews relevant literature and collects data and equipment specifications from past projects in the TFT-LCD manufacturing equipment ( TME ) industry .
The TME costs are predicted using a novel Evolutionary Support Vector Machine Inference Model ( ESIM ) .
The proposed ESIM simultaneously searches for the fittest support vector machine ( SVM ) parameters within a globally optimized model .
An early accurate estimate during the negotiation stage with potential clients can eliminate unnecessary bargaining and significant cost changes in subsequent manufacturing processes .
TFT-LCD manufacturing process A TFT-LCD device has three layers—a liquid–crystal layer encapsulated by two glass substrate layers ( Fig 1 ) , namely , the TFT and color-filter plates ( Clark & Robert , 2001 ) .
The color-filter plate is also utilized as a common electrode plate .
The transparent common electrode on this plate is made of indium tin-oxide ( ITO ) , a conducting glass , and is deposited on top of the color filter ( CF ) layer ( Choe , 2006 ; Okuya , Ito , & Shiozaki , 2007 ) .
The cell gap for the liquid crystal ( i.e. , space between two glass substrates , the TFT and color-filter plates ) must be controlled precisely to within a few micrometers to achieve excellent display quality .
Furthermore , this gap must be uniform and reproducible throughout the entire display .
Typically , transparent spacers , such as plastic beads , are placed on the glass substrate surface to achieve this aim .
TFT-LCD device structure Fig 1 .
TFT-LCD device structure .
Fig 2 shows a typical TFT-LCD fabrication process scheme .
This scheme can be divided into three stages : the array process ; LCD process ; and , LCD module ( LCM ) process ( Clark & Robert , 2001 ) .
The array process stage has two manufacturing processes , namely , fabrication of the TFT and fabrication of the CF .
To manufacture a TFT array , a glass substrate is first chemically cleaned , followed by deposition of an amorphous silicon ( a-Si ) layer on substrate top ( Ibaraki , 1996 ) .
After defining the a-Si area via photolithography and plasma etching , an ITO layer roughly 50–80 nm is sputter-deposited on top of the a-Si layer ; the ITO is then patterned to form pixel electrodes .
The ohmic contact layer in each pixel region is then dry etched using source and drain electrodes as a mask .
Finally , a protective 250 nm silicon nitride layer is deposited by Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition ( PECVD ) and contact windows are opened ( Sehgal , Mangla , Gupta , & Gupta , 2008 ) .
The entire process resembles the manufacturing process for semiconductor devices , except for that of the glass substrate .
Flowchart of the TFT-LCD fabrication process Fig 2 .
Flowchart of the TFT-LCD fabrication process .
The CF is constructed with dyes .
Several methods can be utilized to deposit red , green , and blue ( RGB ) color dyes onto a glass substrate , including diffusion , electro-deposition , and printing .
Moreover , several color-element configurations , including stripe , mosaic , and delta , exist .
Among these many combinations of CF fabrication methods and configurations , the color-resist method with a stripe-type RGB arrangement is the most common approach ( Lee et al. , 2008 ; Sabnis , 1999 ) .
Between the blocks of color in the CF is a black matrix ( BM ) made of a dense metal , such as chromium , to protect a-Si TFTs from stray light , and eliminate light leakage between pixels .
The final process is the application of a protective film and deposition of a 150 nm-thick ITO layer .
During the LCD manufacturing process , the TFT array and CF substrates are then made into an LCD panel by joining the two substrates with a sealant ; the cell gap is maintained by spacers .
The two substrates are laminated together and the panel is then filled with liquid crystals .
In the final manufacturing stage , driver circuits , the Back-light Unit ( BLU ) and other components , are integrated into the panel to complete the LCM ( Smith , 2005 ) .
Current estimation practice and challenges Estimation accuracy is very dependent upon the amount and quality of information available at estimation time .
Thus , achieving highly accurate preliminary cost estimates is extremely challenging ( Berlin , Raz , Glezer , & Zviran , 2009 ; Chou , 2009 ) .
Fig 3 shows the price quotation and engineer-to-order processes integrated with the proposed ESIM .
The primary challenge in current practices is that when a sales manager contacts clients for make-to-order quotes , estimated costs are based solely on known product attributes , while the vast majority of product costs are implicitly determined in the early stages of product development for most manufactured goods .
The make-to-order processes with the proposed ESIM prediction model Fig 3 .
The make-to-order processes with the proposed ESIM prediction model .
The analogous technique is highly subjective and reliant on personal judgment , easily resulting in inaccurate estimates during analytical estimation processes .
Likewise , activity-based costing is extremely dependent upon the availability of detailed design information , which is generally useful , but not ideally suited to early estimations in practice .
The bottom-up estimation process is relatively straightforward and can generate good results when utilized appropriately .
However , without detailed product design specifications , this process leads to inaccurate estimates .
In such cases , manual estimates are unsatisfactory and time-consuming .
Furthermore , high-tech companies typically lose sales personnel at a rapid rate and , thus , have difficulty retaining experience-based and implicit product knowledge .
Conversely , only incomplete equipment design specifications are available during the early quotation and negotiation stages .
Rapidly responding to customer enquiries using little available information is critical to securing orders .
Fairly accurate predictive tools for determining selling prices before an actual device is manufactured are needed for engineered-to-order suppliers to retain competitive advantage in global markets .
Cost estimation techniques Prevailing cost estimation methods typically include analogous cost estimation ( ACE ) , an analytical estimation technique , and artificial intelligence ( AI ) -based approaches ( Bode , 2000 ; Camargo , Rabenasolo , Jolly-Desodt , & Castelain , 2003 ; Duverlie & Castelain , 1999 ; Kwak & Watson , 2005 ; Marban , Menasalvas , & Fernandez-Baizan , 2008 ; Metaxiotis , 2004 ; PMI , 2004 ) .
The ACE process uses values of such parameters as project duration , size , cost , and construction complexity from a similar product to estimate the cost of a new product .
This technique , which is frequently employed to estimate cost early in a product ’ s lifecycle when little information is available , requires both sufficient knowledge and expert judgment .
AI is related to computer system designs that attempt to resolve problems intelligently by emulating human brain processes .
As AI technology enhances the ability of computer programs to handle tasks ( Haykin , 1999 ) , employing AI models are suitable for solving project cost management problems .
Various scientific and engineering fields have increased their attention in recent years on hybrid AI paradigms to achieve greater efficacy .
A number of studies have demonstrated that cost estimation performance achieved by combining different AI techniques is better than those achieved by employing a single technique ( Chen , 2007 ; Kim & Shin , 2007 ; Lee , 2009 ; Li et al. , 2005 ; Min , Lee , & Han , 2006 ; Nandi et al. , 2004 ; Wu , Tzeng , & Lin , 2009 ; Wu , 2010 ) .
Fast messy genetic algorithms ( fmGAs ) and the SVM are two tools that have been applied successfully to solve various management problems .
Considering the characteristics and merits of each , this study combines fmGAs and an SVM to develop a novel ESIM to estimate the cost of TFT-LCD manufacturing equipment .
An early accurate estimate generated during the negotiation stage with clients can eliminate unnecessary bargaining and cost changes in subsequent manufacturing processes .
In the ESIM , the SVM is employed primarily for learning and curve fitting , while the fmGA optimizes prediction error .
This ESIM was developed to achieve the fittest C and γ parameters while minimizing prediction error .
Implicit knowledge from historical cases can be obtained using the novel approach for sales managers or decision-makers during early quotation stages to overcome challenges in the TFT-LCD process equipment industry .
Support vector machines and fmGAs represent recently developed AI paradigms .
An SVM was first developed by ( Vapnik , 1995 ) ; SVMs have recently been applied to a wide range of problems in various disciplines that include customer churn prediction ( Coussement & Van den Poel , 2008 ) , reliability forecasting in engine systems ( Chen , 2007 ) , document categorization ( Hao , Chiang , & Tu , 2007 ) , credit rating ( Lee , 2007 ) , content-based image retrieval ( Seo , 2007 ) , Fault diagnosis ( Widodo & Yang , 2007 ) , feature selection and pattern recognition ( AcIr , 2006 ; Kim & Shin , 2007 ; Li et al. , 2005 ) , prediction of air entrainment rate and aeration efficiency of weirs ( Baylar , Hanbay , & Batan , 2009 ) , and bankruptcy prediction ( Shin , Lee , & Kim , 2005 ) .
The SVM classifies data with different class labels by determining a set of support vectors that are members of the set of training inputs that outline a hyper plane in a feature space .
It utilizes a generic mechanism that employs a kernel function to fit the hyper plane surface to training data .
A user may select the SVM kernel function ( e.g. , linear , polynomial , or sigmoid function ) during the training process to identify support vectors along the function surface .
However , when using an SVM , users encounter the problem of how to set optimal kernel parameters .
Therefore , SVM parameters must be obtained at the same time as achieving optimal parameter settings .
Appropriate parameter settings can improve SVM prediction accuracy , with parameters to be optimized , including penalty parameter C , and kernel function parameters , the gamma of the radial basis function ( RBF ) kernel .
In designing an SVM , one must choose a kernel function , set kernel parameters and determine a soft margin constant C ( penalty parameter ) .
Fig 4 shows the SVM procedure .
The SVM procedure Fig 4 .
The SVM procedure .
The grid algorithm is an alternative to finding the best C and γ parameters when using the RBF kernel function .
However , this method is time consuming and does not perform well ( Huang & Wang , 2006 ) .
An fmGA was first developed by Goldberg et al .
Unlike the well-known simple GA ( sGA ) , which uses fixed length strings to represent possible solutions , an fmGA applies messy chromosomes to form strings of various lengths .
Its ability to identify efficiently optimal solutions for large-scale permutation problems means that the fmGA has the ability to generate SVM parameters C and γ simultaneously .
In the proposed ESIM , an SVM is employed for learning and curve fitting , while the fmGA optimizes prediction error .
This model was developed to obtain the fittest C and γ parameters with minimized prediction error .
The ESIM adaptation process can be demonstrated with a pseudo code algorithm which is developed by the authors ( Cheng & Wu , 2009 ) and applied to project management effectively .
Fig 5 shows the ESIM flowchart .
A detailed explanation of this flowchart follows .
( 1 ) Training the SVM .
In this step , the SVM uses default parameters and a training dataset to train a prediction model .
( 2 ) Fitness evaluation .
For each chromosome representing C and γ , a training dataset is employed to train the SVM and calculate the prediction accuracy .
When accuracy is sufficient , each chromosome is evaluated using a fitness function .
( 3 ) Termination criteria .
The process stops once termination criteria are satisfied .
When criteria are not satisfied , the model proceeds to the next generation .
( 4 ) The search for fmGA parameters .
In this stage , the model searches for superior solutions via genetic operations .

The study company , located in Southern Taiwan Science Park , is a world-leading equipment manufacturer that caters to Taiwanese TFT-LCD panel manufacturers , including Chi Mei Optoelectronics , AU Optronics , Innolux Display Corp. , Chunghwa Picture Tubes , Ltd. , Allied Material Technology Corp. , and TPO Displays Corp. An industry report for Taiwan ’ s TFT-LCD industry predicts that 1.2 billion LCD TVs will exist worldwide by 2015 ( PIDA , 2008 ) .
The study company fabricates over 15 types of manufacturing equipment for TFT-LCD production .
The laser repair ( Repair ) , light-on-test ( LOT ) , and macro inspection systems ( Macro ) account for 48 % of total revenue for the company over the last 3 years .
Since obtaining a complete collection of data for all previous projects is unlikely due to the lack of a centralized project management information system ( PMIS ) , the primary goal is to generalize prediction capability of AI-based techniques using available project data .
Based on the principle of priority management , Repair , LOT , and Macro systems were treated as target samples and thereafter utilized in prediction model development .
TFT-LCD inspection and repairing equipment In TFT-LCD manufacturing , especially for large products such as TVs , display panels must have high resolutions and excellent picture quality , in particular , high luminance , a high contrast ratio , wide viewing angle and rapid refresh rates ( Pardo , Pe´rez , & Suero , 2004 ) .
Therefore , to ensure a high yield rate for products meeting these criteria and reduce costs , strict quality-assurance and quality-control measures must be applied by manufacturers , meaning careful inspection of panels plays a central role in the manufacturing process .
Consequently , products with defects or imperfections can be identified and repaired or recycled .
Panel inspections employ various examination methods that use , say , optical instruments , electrical instruments , and even the human eye ( Gaillet , Yan , & Teboul , 2007 ; Park & Yoo , 2009 ) .
For example , during the LCM process , many spot-type defects can occur on the LCM surface .
These defects are classified as macro-defects and micro-defects , which can be detected by macro- and micro-inspection systems , respectively .
Inspection of such defects is extremely important to determining whether an LCM is defect-free .
Fig 6 presents a common macro-inspection system .
Macro inspection system Fig 6 .
Macro inspection system .
The LOT is also an important quality-control measure system used during the panel and module assembly processes when manufacturing TFT-LCDs .
Generally , the process includes inspection of the panel surface , modules , and picture display quality .
Fig 7 shows a common system for inspecting LOT .
Light-on-test ( LOT ) system Fig 7 .

Defects can be repaired when identified .
A typical repair system has a laser repair unit , tape grinding unit , color repair unit , and dry film repair unit ( Ishikawa et al. , 2005 ; Kim , 2007 ; Ning , Li , Lu , Li , & Yao , 2003 ) .
For instance , a laser repair unit uses a solid-state 355/532 nm-wavelength laser to repair devices .
Fig 8 shows a typical laser repair system .

Descriptive statistics of TFT-LCD project data The study company transformed itself into a high-tech company in the 1990s by specializing in developing TFT-LCD manufacturing and testing equipment .
Despite its rapid business growth , management has paid little attention to the PMIS and project files were archived in various departments on paper or electronically .
Although a PMIS are important to PMs , some problems exist ( i.e. , the extent to which a PMIS should be customized , and software efficacy , reliability , effort spent and the benefit/cost ratio ) for most manufacturing-oriented companies using a PMIS .
Additionally , experienced personnel often prevent mistakes by being reluctant to change from a familiar working environment .
The data preprocessing stage consumed considerable time as the research team needed to acquire cost data and related parameters from manual documents , project files , and accounting information .
For instance , geometrical and physical features of equipment were collected from the R & D department ; manufacturing process data were acquired from the product management department ; client and order data were obtained from the business and marketing department ; receivable and payment data were acquired from the finance and accounting department ; contract and patent adoption issues were obtained from the legal department ; and equipment layouts were acquired from the engineering and design department .
Consequently , the company should store operational project data in a centralized data warehouse to archive project knowledge as a corporate asset and facilitate business intelligence discovery .
Developing a model for estimation of TFT-LCD manufacturing equipment cost during early in the price quotation stage requires careful selection of features that have predictive relationships in the manufacturing process .
These features must be identified based on equipment functions and characteristics ( e.g. , size , weight , shape , process , and equipment type ) ; these features can be obtained easily from a client during the conceptual stage .
Notably , quoted prices were not traceable in the study company , and only actual close-out cost data after equipment delivery were obtainable .
A pilot analysis indicates that the explanatory power ( R-square ) and standard error of time-adjusted cost data compared with those of non-adjusted cost data is minimal .
Equipment development costs were therefore not converted into base production year .
Due to the accessibility and availability of project data , trade-offs were made while selecting factors for construction of subsequent models .
After consulting experienced engineers and extracting product attributes from documents , the following candidate factors ( Table 1 ) were determined as potential predictors ( input ) for preliminary cost estimates of TFT-LCD manufacturing equipment .

After aggregation of multiple orders from the same client , sample size was reduced to 129 projects and a derived variable , number of orders ( NOOs ) , was created to account for the impact of multiple orders on quoted price .
The geometrical features comprise the physical properties of fabrication equipment .
The size range of glass substrate in product lines was 316 × 538 ( mm ) to 2200 × 2500 ( mm ) .
The LCD panel applications varied depending on the TFT-LCD products under production ( e.g. , monitors , TVs , portable PCs , e-books , and communication products ) .
The production characteristics are fabrication equipment types—Macro , LOT , and Repair—and patents employed to fabricate these manufacturing machines .
The manufacturing processes include those for TFTs , CFs , LCDs , and LCMs .
A nominal variable represents customers placing orders .
Some variables , such as payment conditions , were adopted to represent client financial planning .
ESIM performance and prediction accuracy for Repair , Macro and LOT The historical cases were used as training sets based on equipment type ( Table 2 ) .
Macro , LOT , and Repair prediction models were then trained , respectively Neter , Kutner , Nachtsheim , and Wasserman ( 1996 ) suggested that the best means of model testing is by collecting new data , enabling users to determine the applicability of a model to data beyond those on which the model is based ( Neter et al. , 1996 ) .
Thus , data for newly completed projects were randomly obtained upon verification of model training for test purposes .

Similar analytical results are obtained for LOT and Repair system development cost predictions ( Tables 4 and 5 ) , while the LOT prediction has minimal MAPE and RMSE in training or test datasets .
For the prediction performance via the MAPE , the LOT system is 3.427 % , superior to Macro ( 11.617 % ) and Repair ( 5.658 % ) in terms of forecasting new cases .
Figs .

Generally , the overall MAPE of ESIM prediction performance is 4.525 % for the training dataset of the Macro , LOT , and Repair systems .
For new cases , the overall MAPE of test cases is 7.707 % .
The testing RMSE of each equipment are nearly comparable with the training RMSE .

Furthermore , roughly 88 % of the test cases have prediction errors < 13.59 % .
These prediction errors range at 0.355–25.708 % .
The analytical results show that the proposed ESIM approach outperforms the current analogous estimating procedure adopted in the TFT-LCD manufacturing equipment industry , which is 16.1 % in general or worse based on the observations from the actual records and interviews with in-house project managers .
On average , the proposed ESIM approach outperforms the current analogous estimation procedure by 52.1 % for the test dataset .
This study forecasts the costs of equipment used to fabricate TFT-LCDs using the novel ESIM .
The ESIM is a hybrid intelligence technique integrating an SVM with an fmGA .
The SVM primarily addresses learning and curve fitting by mapping input and output , and the fmGA primarily deals with global optimization concurrently while minimizing prediction error .
The investigation demonstrates that the proposed ESIM can accurately predict the costs of TFT-LCD fabrication equipment ( Marco , LOT , and Repair systems ) .
Analytical results indicate that the overall MAPE is 4.525 % for training datasets for the Macro , LOT , and Repair systems .
For the randomly collected data for testing , the overall MAPE is 7.707 % .
Based on the performance measures , the proposed ESIM approach is adequate in predicting development prices of TFT-LCD equipment at early development stages as prediction error is within a satisfactory limit .
The prediction performance using the ESIM is better than that of the current conventional analogous technique , achieving an average accuracy improvement of 52.1 % .
The strong global demand for TFT LCD panels is reflected in the multiple sizes available commercially .
With experience , good judgment and timely adjustments , systematic knowledge discovery from sales records offers PMs of high-tech manufacturing equipment an effective and efficient way of estimating costs and quoting prices in the early stages of development for customers .
Future work can focus on the development of a user-friendly computing system embedded with ESIM to help PMs acquire reference costs in a timely manner .
