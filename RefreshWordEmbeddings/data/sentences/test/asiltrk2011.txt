Machine parts during their useful life are significantly influenced by surface roughness quality .
The machining process is more complex , and therefore , it is very hard to develop a comprehensive model involving all cutting parameters .
In this study , the surface roughness is measured during turning at different cutting parameters such as speed , feed , and depth of cut .
Full factorial experimental design is implemented to increase the confidence limit and reliability of the experimental data .
Artificial neural networks ( ANN ) and multiple regression approaches are used to model the surface roughness of AISI 1040 steel .
Multiple regression and neural network-based models are compared using statistical methods .
It is clearly seen that the proposed models are capable of prediction of the surface roughness .
The ANN model estimates the surface roughness with high accuracy compared to the multiple regression model .
Machined surface characteristics greatly affect the fatigue strength , corrosion resistance and tribological properties of machined components .
The surface finish obtained after machining determines the quality of material .
High surface roughness values reduce the fatigue life .
Therefore , control of the machined surface is essential to safe turning operations ( Sharma , Suresh , Rakesh , & Sharma , 2008 ) .
Machine parts that are in contact with other elements or materials during their useful life are influenced by surface quality and dimensional precision .
Therefore , the most important aspects in manufacturing processes are measuring and characterizing of surface properties .
The surface roughness is one of the important properties of workpiece quality in the turning process .
A good surface roughness and hence poor surface roughness improve the tribological properties , fatigue strength , corrosion resistance , and esthetic appeal of the product .
The various models for the optimum surface roughness have been reported in several research works .
These models can be arranged as follows : the multiple regression technique , mathematical modeling based on the physics of the process , the fuzzy-set-based technique , and neural network modeling ( Arbizu & Pérez , 2003 ; Kohli & Dixit , 2005 ; Risbood , Dixit , & Sahasrabudhe , 2003 ) .
The studies of some researchers on turning and milling are given below .
Thiele and Melkote ( 1999 ) carried out an experimental investigation of effects of workpiece hardness and tool edge geometry on surface roughness in finish hard turning using CBN tools .
They applied an analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) to the experimental results in order to distinguish whether differences in surface quality for various runs were statistically important .
Feng and Wang ( 2002 ) focus on developing an empirical model for the prediction of surface roughness using non linear regression analysis with logarithmic data transformation in finish turning .
Also , they investigated the impact of workpiece hardness , feed , tool point angle , depth of cut , spindle speed , and cutting time on the surface roughness .
Chou , Evans , and Barash ( 2002 ) studied the performance and wear behavior of different cubic boron nitride ( CBN ) tools in finish turning of hardened AISI 52100 steel .
Tool performance was evaluated by taking into the part surface finish and the tool flank wear .
Zuperl and Cus ( 2003 ) proposed a neural network-based approach to ensure simple , fast , and efficient optimization of all important turning parameters .
They used the multi-objective optimization technique for cutting conditions taking into consideration the technological , economic , and organizational limitations .
Özel and Karpat ( 2005 ) presented a neural network modeling to predict surface roughness and tool flank wear over the machining time for variety of cutting conditions in finish hard turning .
They also developed the regression models in order to capture process-specific parameters by using the experimental data obtained from hardened AISI H-13 and AISI 52100 steels .
Sharma et al .
( 2008 ) proposed a neural network modeling to estimate surface roughness in turning operations .
Machining variables ( i.e .
cutting forces and surface roughness ) are measured during turning at different cutting parameters such as approaching angle , speed , feed , and depth of cut .
Ho , Tsai , Lin , and Chou ( 2009 ) used an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system ( ANFIS ) with the genetic learning algorithm to predict the workpiece surface roughness in the end milling process .
They applied the hybrid Taguchi-genetic learning algorithm ( HTGLA ) in the ANFIS to determine the most suitable membership functions .
Zain , Haron , & Sharif , 2010 presented the ANN model for predicting the surface roughness in the end milling machining process .
They recommended that the best combination of cutting conditions for achieving the best surface roughness value could be obtained at high speed with a low feed rate and radial rake angle .
The aim of present study is to develop an effective approach based on artificial neural networks and multiple regression to predict the surface roughness in AISI 1040 steel .
For this purpose , full factorial experimental design is implemented to investigate the effect of the cutting parameters ( i.e .
cutting speed , feed rate , and depth of cut ) on the surface roughness .
The multiple regression models are tested by aiding the analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) .
Multilayer perception ( MLP ) architecture with back-propagation algorithm having two different variants is used in neural network .
The performances of multiple regression and neural network-based models are compared by means of statistical methods .
The proposed models can be used effectively to predict the surface roughness in turning process .
The results obtained show that ANN produces the better results compared to multiple regression .
Modeling of surface roughness In turning , there are many factors affecting the surface roughness such as tool variables , workpiece variables , and cutting conditions .
Tool variables consist of tool material , nose radius , rake angle , cutting edge geometry , tool vibration , tool point angle , etc. , while workpiece variables comprise material , hardness , and other mechanical properties .
Furthermore , cutting conditions include speed , feed , and depth of cut .
Since the hard turning process contains many parameters , it is complex and difficult to select the appropriate cutting conditions and tool geometry for achieving the required surface quality ( Singh & Rao , 2007 ) .
Therefore , some scientific approaches are required to represent the process .
It is clear that the proper model selection for the surface roughness is essential for the machining of hard materials .
The surface roughness average Ra is generally defined on the basis of the ISO 4287 norm , which is the arithmetical mean of the deviations of the roughness profile from the central line lm along the measurement .
This definition is given in Eq ( 1 ) ( Arbizu & Pérez , 2003 ) .
( 1 ) where L is the sampling length , and y is coordinate of the profile curve .
The relationship between the surface roughness and independent machining variables can be defined as : ( 2 ) where Ra is the surface roughness in μm ; V , f , d , and r are the cutting speed ( m/min ) , feed rate ( mm/rev ) , depth of cut ( mm ) , and tool nose radius ( mm ) , respectively .
C , n , m , p , and l are constants and ε is random error .
Eq ( 1 ) can be given as shown in Eq ( 3 ) in order to facilitate the presentation of the constants and parameters .
The arithmetic average height Ra and maximum peak to valley height Rt of turned surfaces can be computed as follows : ( 3 ) ( 4 ) where r = tool nose radius ( mm ) and f = feed rate ( mm/rev ) .
Eqs .
( 3 ) and ( 4 ) show that while surface roughness proportionally increases with the feed rate , a large tool nose radius reduces the surface roughness of a turned workpiece .
The model does not consider any imperfections in the process such as tool vibration or chip adhesion ( Sharma et al. , 2008 ) .
Multiple regression modeling for surface roughness Multiple regression is a statistical technique that allows us to determine the correlation between a continuous dependent variable and two or more continuous or discrete independent variables .
It can be used for a variety of purposes such as analyzing of experimental , ordinal , or categorical data .
Thus , it can be considered to be helpful in predicting the surface roughness ( Reddy , Padmanabhan , & Reddy , 2008 ) .
In order to predict the surface roughness , the second-order regression equation can be expressed as : ( 5 ) Ra is the estimated surface roughness and V , f , and a are the cutting speed , feed rate , and depth of cut , respectively .
The coefficients β0 , β1 , β2 , … , β9 are to be estimated using suitable methods .
Thereafter , the analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) is used to seek the relationship between a response variable ( output parameter ) and two or more continuous or discrete independent variables .
The performance criterions given in Eqs .
( 12 ) and ( 13 ) are applied to compare the developed models .
Surface roughness prediction strategy using artificial neural network Artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) emulating the biological connections between neurons are known as soft computing techniques .
ANNs can reproduce some functions of human behavior , which are formed by a finite number of layers with different computing elements called neurons .
In order to construct a network , the neurons are interconnected .
The organization of connections determines the type and objectives of the ANNs .
The processing ability of the network is stored in the interunit connection strengths , or weights , which are tuned in the learning process .
The training algorithm ( or learning ) is defined as a procedure that consists of adjusting the weights and biases of a network that minimize selected function of the error between the actual and desired outputs ( Gareta , Romeo , & Gil , 2006 ; Kalogirou , 2003 ; Karatas , Sozen , & Dulek , 2009 ) .
ANNs are widely used in many applications such as forecasting , control , data compression , pattern recognition , speech , vision , medicine , and power systems .
Neural network models provide an alternative approach to analyze the data , because they can deduce patterns in the data .
A simple process element of the ANN is shown in Fig 1 .
The network has three layers ; the input , hidden , and output layers .
The input and output layers are defined as nodes , and the hidden layer provides a relation between the input and output layers .
Initially , the weights of the nodes are random and the network has not any knowledge .
For a given input pattern , the network produces an associated output pattern .
Its learning and update procedure is based on a relatively simple concept : the network is provided with both a set of patterns to be learned and the desired system response for each pattern .
If the network generates the wrong answer , then the weights are updated to be less error .
Finally , future responses of the network are more likely to be correct ( Kermanshahi & Iwamiya , 2002 ) .

Artificial intelligence methods could have been used in the stages of manufacturing .
Machining is one of the basic manufacturing techniques used in the industry .
Manufacturers must minimize cost and process time , and additionally , the product must comply with the required dimensions and quality criteria for a better competition ( Asiltürk & Ünüvar , 2009 ) .
In this study , ANN structure shown in Fig 2 is used for modeling and predicting surface roughness in turning operations .
This fully connected hierarchical network structure has an input layer , a hidden layer , and an output layer .
The back-propagation learning algorithms such as scaled conjugate gradient ( SCG ) and Levenberg–Marquardt ( LM ) are used to update the parameters in feed forward single hidden layers .
The cutting speed ( V ) , feed ( f ) , and depth of cut ( d ) are considered as the process parameters .
The input layers of the neural network consist of three neurons whereas the output layer has a single neuron that represents the predicted value of surface roughness .
ANN structure Fig 2 .
ANN structure .
Some parameters ( i.e .
the number of training and testing data , learning rate , number of hidden layers , and processing function used ) affect the accuracy , reliability , and effectiveness of the neural network .
It is seen that the processing functions , logsig and tansig , produce almost the same performance in different problems .
The experiments show that the double hidden layer network has any advantage over single hidden layer network ( Kohli & Dixit , 2005 ) .
Hence , only the logsig processing function and single hidden layer have been used .
A trial and error scheme has been used to determine the appropriate number of hidden neurons .
The number of hidden neurons was determined as four and five neurons .
Since the input parameters were in different ranges , this parameters were normalized within 0.1–0.9 ranges in order to prevent the simulated neurons from being driven too far into saturation .
The maximum number of epochs and the learning rate value for each run were selected as 10,000 and 0.9 , respectively .
Ten independent runs having different initial random weights were performed to achieve a good solution .
The error during the learning called as mean squared error ( MSE ) is calculated as follows : ( 6 ) where t is target value , o is output value , and p is pattern .
The weights between hidden layer and output layer are adjusted and are again calculated using the chain rule of differentiation as follows : ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) where η is the learning rate parameter and α is the momentum coefficient .
Experimental setup Data sets are from experiments conducted on a CNC turning machine in the laboratory of the Selçuk University , Konya , Turkey .
The details of the machining experiments are given in Table 1 .
Single insert was used in the experiments for machining of AISI 1040 steel .
After each turning operation , the surface roughness ( Ra ) was measured with Surface Roughness Tester Mitotoyo ( SJ-301 ) .
The measurements were taken three times for each workpiece .
A National Instruments portable E Series NI DAQCard-6036E with maximum acquisition rate of 200,000 samples per second and 16 channels , data acquisition card was used to transmit the data to PC .
A software called as ilhan_daq_v01 was developed using Matlab 6.5 program .
The constants and cutting parameters were entered to the interface .
The outputs were measured as 80 samples/sec , and their average values were recorded as one datum .
Consequently , tests were performed with 27 experimental runs .
The workpiece material in the tests was selected to represent the major group of workpiece materials used in industry .
In this study , AISI 1040 working specimen was used .
It is hardened to 35 HRC , and then normalization was made at 900 °C for the homogeneity of material .
The specimen was cylindrical bar with 90 mm diameter and 60 mm length ( measured from chuck to tail stock ) .
The discontinuous or unexpected hardening distribution on specimens can appear due to the extrusion production process .
Therefore in order to remove the outer layer , before the experiments , the specimens were turned with 2.0 mm cutting depth .
The block diagram of the experiment set is shown in Fig 3 .

Experimental setup .
The cutting tests have been carried out on Moriseiki NL2500MC/700 lathe .
The cutting tool MWLNR 25X25 is a commercial product available by Iscar Company .
Carbide inserts with product number Tips WNMG 080408-TF MTCVD TiCN and a thick alpha Al2O3 CVD coating were used .
The cutting parameters were selected so that the measured cutting forces would not exceed the upper limit of the dynamometer working rate .
The cutting parameters suggested by cutting tool supplier are given in Table 1 .
In order to keep the cutting conditions unchanged , each experiment was conducted with new sharp tools .
The cutting tests were carried out without coolant , and totally 27 experiments were performed according to full factorial design .
The roughness parameters generally depend on the manufacturing conditions like feed , depth of cut , cutting speed , machine tool , and cutting tool rigidity , etc .
In this study , three main cutting parameters , cutting speed ( V ) , feed ( f ) , and depth ( d ) of cut are selected .
Three level tests for each factor were used because the considered variables are multi-level variables and their outcome effects are not linear .

In this section , the results obtained from the multiple regression and neural networks are compared and discussed .
Multiple regression analysis The data presented in Table 2 have been used to build the multiple regression model .
The coefficients β0 , β1 , β2 , … , β9 are estimated with the least square method using MINITAB 14 .
Accordingly , the equation of the second-order fitted model for surface roughness is given as follows : ( 11 ) The feed rate is the most dominant factor on the surface roughness , followed by the depth of cut and cutting speed , respectively .
It is obvious that there is a good correlation ( R2 = 98.9 % ) between the surface roughness and cutting parameters .
The significance of the multiple regression coefficients for second-order model ( R2 , determination coefficient ) is 0.989 .
It can be said that the second-order model can explain the variation with accuracy , 98.9 % .
Fig 4 shows the comparison of measured and predicted data of the surface roughness for the multiple regressions .
It is seen from Fig 4 that there is a strong relationship between the predictor variables and response variable .

The ANOVA test was used to determine the dependency of surface roughness to selected machining parameters .
Besides , the main effects of these variables and the interactions of them were included to the analysis .
The results of this test are shown in Table 3 .
It can be said from Table 3 that regarding the main effects , the greatest influence on the surface roughness is exhibited by the feed rate ( f ) , followed by depth of cut ( a ) and cutting speed ( V ) .
Furthermore , V * f shows the greatest contribution as the interactions .
The ANOVA test was performed at a significance level of 5 % i.e. , confidence level of 95 % .
Since P value given in Table 3 is less than 0.05 , the developed model is significant .
According to the other hypothesis , if at least one of these coefficients is not equal to zero , the model will be accepted .
It is seen from Table 3 that this hypothesis is confirmed .

After the network has successfully completed the training stage , it was tested with the experimental data that were not present in the training data set .
The results obtained were compared using statistical methods .
The performance criteria considered are the mean absolute percentage error ( MAPE ) and the determination coefficient ( R2 ) ( 12 ) ( 13 ) where N is the number of patterns .
The statistical error values for the ANN approaches are presented in Table 5 .
For the surface roughness , the best approach having the minimum error is achieved by SCG algorithm with five neurons .
The activation function in this study is as follows : ( 14 ) where Ei is the weighted sum of the input parameters and is calculated as : ( 15 ) where I1 , I2 , and I3 are the input parameters : the cutting speed , feed , and depth of cut , respectively .

Overall evaluation A full factorial experimentation design is implemented to seek the effects of the cutting parameters ( i.e .
cutting speed , feed rate , and depth of cut ) on the surface roughness .
After each turning operation , the measurements of surface roughness were recorded .
Artificial neural network and multiple regression models were developed to predict the surface roughness using the experimental data .
Table 7 shows the comparison results according to accuracy values of multiple regression model and neural network model .
The results are generally found to be close to the directly measured data for all methods .
So the proposed models can be used effectively to predict the surface roughness in turning process .
However , as can be seen from the performance criterion in Table 7 , ANN produces the better results compared to multiple regression .
It is important to note that the ANN model is very successful at the training stage but it is not good enough at the test data .
