Secondary phases such as Laves and carbides are formed during the final solidification stages of nickel based superalloy coatings deposited during the gas tungsten arc welding cold wire process .
However , when aged at high temperatures , other phases can precipitate in the microstructure , like the γ″ and δ phases .
This work presents a new application and evaluation of artificial intelligent techniques to classify ( the background echo and backscattered ) ultrasound signals in order to characterize the microstructure of a Ni-based alloy thermally aged at 650 and 950 °C for 10 , 100 and 200 h. The background echo and backscattered ultrasound signals were acquired using transducers with frequencies of 4 and 5 MHz .
Thus with the use of features extraction techniques , i.e. , detrended fluctuation analysis and the Hurst method , the accuracy and speed in the classification of the secondary phases from ultrasound signals could be studied .
The classifiers under study were the recent optimum-path forest ( OPF ) and the more traditional support vector machines and Bayesian .
The experimental results revealed that the OPF classifier was the fastest and most reliable .
In addition , the OPF classifier revealed to be a valid and adequate tool for microstructure characterization through ultrasound signals classification due to its speed , sensitivity , accuracy and reliability .
Nb-bearing nickel-based superalloys , like the Inconel 625 alloy studied here , exhibit an outstanding combination of mechanical properties and resistance to pitting , crevice and intergranular corrosion due to the stiffening effect of chromium , molybdenum and niobium in its nickel matrix .
These properties make precipitation hardening treatments unnecessary ( Mathew , Rao , & Mannan , 1999 ) .
The extraordinary resistance against a wide range of organic and mineral acids is due to their excellent anti-corrosive properties , mainly at high temperatures .
These alloys are commonly found in the marine , aerospace , chemical and oil and gas industries ( Boser , 1979 ; Kohla & Peng , 1981 ; Thomas & Tait , 1994 ) .
The Inconel 625 alloy in particular has greater applicability , especially in highly corrosive environments such as the oil and gas industry , than many other Nickel ( Ni ) based alloys .
Nowadays , this alloy is used widely in the weld overlay of the inner surface of carbon steel pipes and other equipment for the offshore industry .
However , further studies of this alloy , such as this paper , are necessary to increase the overall knowledge of its properties .
During welding of an Inconel 625 alloy , there is an intensive microsegregation of some elements , such as niobium ( Nb ) and molybdenum ( Mo ) , within the interdendritic regions , causing the supersaturation of the liquid metal with these chemical elements in its final stage of solidification , which results in the precipitation of Nb-rich Laves phase and MC primary carbides of type NbC ( Cieslak , 1981 ; Cieslak , Headley , & Romig , 1986 ) .
This segregation and precipitation of the secondary phases can change the mechanical properties of the alloy and decrease its resistance to corrosion ( Yang , Zheng , Sun , Guan , & Hu , 2006 ) .
In addition , the Nb-rich Laves phase has a low melting point that causes an increase in the temperature solidification range , making the alloy susceptible to solidification cracking ( Dupont , Banovic , & Marder , 2003 ) .
However , an adequate selection of the welding conditions can minimize the formation of the Nb-rich Laves phases and consequently , reduce its susceptibility to solidification cracking .
Therefore , it is also important to investigate the phase transformation process .
Nowadays , researchers are evaluating the use artificial intelligence techniques to characterize microstructures .
For example , Albuquerque , Filho , Cavalcante , and Tavares ( 2010 ) quantified the porosity of synthetic materials from optical microscopic images successfully , and the solution proposed , which was based on an artificial neuronal network ( ANN ) , proved to be more reliable .
Albuquerque , de Alexandria , Cortez , and Tavares ( 2009 ) characterized the microstructures in images of nodular , grey , and malleable cast irons using a multilayer perceptron neuronal network ( MLP ) ( Albuquerque , Cortez , de Alexandria , & Tavares , 2008 ) , Kohonen ’ s self-organizing artificial neuronal network ( Albuquerque et al. , 2009 ) , and using optimum-path forest ( OPF ) classifier ( Papa , Nakamura , Albuquerque , Falcão , & Tavares , 2013 ) .
To evaluate the microstructures of hypoeutectic white cast iron accurately , morphological operators together with an MLP neuronal network ( Albuquerque , Tavares , & Cortez , 2010 ) were necessary .
However , the application of this techniques are not combined with non-destructive tests ( i.e , ultrasound inspection ) , this being one of the main innovations of this work .
However , despite the above mentioned techniques , improved classification methods for microstructural characterization are still required .
To the best of our knowledge , this work introduces the fast , robust and recent OPF classifier , for first time to characterize and classify the microstructure of a thermally aged Ni-based alloy and in the as-welded state .
This recent graph-based classifier reduces the pattern recognition problem as an optimum-path forest computation in the feature space induced by a graph , ( Papa , Falcão , & Suzuki , 2009 ) .
As such , the OPF classifier does not interpret the classification task as a hyperplane optimization problem as traditional classifiers , but as a polynomial combinatorial optimum-path computation from some key samples , designated as prototypes , to the remaining nodes .
A detailed description of the OPF classifier will be carried out in Section 2.5.1 .
Therefore , the main goal of this work was to evaluate the competence of the OPF classifier to monitor , thought ultrasound signal classification , the kinetics of the phase transformation of a Ni-based alloy thermally aged at 650 and 950 °C for 10 , 100 and 200 h , as well as in the as-welded state .
Detrended-fluctuation analysis ( DFA ) and Hurst method ( Rescaled range – RS ) were used in the feature extraction phase ( i.e. , preprocessing ) .
Raw data ( original ) and preprocessed ultrasonic background echo and backscattered signals acquired with two types of transducers ( 4 and 5 MHz ) were considered .
For a further assessment of the OPF efficiency , the results obtained were compared with the ones achieved using the powerful classifiers , in particular the SVM and Bayesian classifiers .
The potentiality and efficiency of ultrasonic signals combined with artificial intelligence classifiers to characterize the microstructures of a Ni-based alloy thermally aged and in the as-welded state were confirmed by the results .
As far as the authors know , this is the first time that the effect of thermal aging on a Ni-based alloy has been analyzed using such classifiers on ultrasonic signals , which makes the results presented and discussed of noteworthy value .
This paper is organized as follows : in the next section , the experimental procedures are described ; then , in the third section , the experimental results are presented and discussed ; finally , in the fourth and last section , the conclusions are pointed out .
This section describes the experimental work done to the temperatures 650 and 950 ° C for 10 , 100 and 200 h , as well as the as-welded condition .
First ; the test setup is described , then the preparation of the Inconel 625 alloy samples is addressed .
Afterwards , the ultrasonic signals acquired and the related fundamentals are introduced .
Finally , the features of extraction methods and artificial intelligence techniques used to process and classify the ultrasonic signals are presented .
Test setup Inconel 625 alloy coatings deposited on an ASTM A36 steel metal base were used in the experiments .
The chemical compositions of these materials are given in Albuquerque , Silva , Normando , Moura , and Tavares ( 2012 ) .
For the welding a 4 mm diameter tungsten electrode doped with thorium was used , and pure argon ( 99.99 % ) was chosen as the shielding gas .
An electronic multi-process power source connected to the data acquisition system monitored the current and tension during the welding .
The manipulation of the torch was carried out using an industrial robot system , Fig 1 ( a ) .
An automatic cold wire feed system for gas tungsten arc welding ( GTAW ) was used to supply the filler metal .
Fig 1 ( b ) shows the positioning unit that was used to guide the wire into the arc .
This unit allows adjustments to be made to the configuration parameters and geometry of the wire feed .
The weld coating was applied on an ASTM A36 steel metal base plate , resulting in a coating of 350 × 60 × 14 mm3 .
The remaining welding parameters used were : 285 A of welding current ( DCEN ) , arc voltage of 20 V , travel speed equal to 21 cm/min , welding heat input of 16 kJ/cm , the wire feed speed equal to 6.0 m/min , arc length of 10 mm , 15 l/min of gas flow and arc oscillation describing a double-8 trajectory .
Other minor considerations included the wire feed direction ahead of the arc weld , wire tip to pool surface was kept at a distance of 3 mm , the wire feeding angle was maintained constant and equal to 50° , and the electrode tip angle was fixed at 50° .
To guarantee good overlaying with multiple passes deposited side by side , a distance equal to 2/3 of the initial weld bead width was established as an ideal step .
Other arc oscillating parameters were : oscillation amplitude of 8 mm and wave length equal to 1.2 mm .
Experimental setup used in the welding process : ( a ) robotic system , ( b ) GTAW… Fig 1 .
Experimental setup used in the welding process : ( a ) robotic system , ( b ) GTAW guide wire feed and torch .
To produce a 10 mm thick coating on the substrate , seven layers with eight passes were deposited under identical welding conditions .
Samples preparation After the welding , the coating was detached from the substrate by conventional machining , as the material of interest was only the Inconel 625 alloy .
Then , the coating was divided into seven samples ; three samples were submitted to heat aging treatments at 650 °C , three at 950 °C and both for aging times of 10 , 100 and 200 h ( Shankar , Rao , & Mannan , 2001 ) , and the remaining one was kept as the as-welded state ( 0 h ) .
The aged samples were water cooled with moderate agitation at room temperature .
Afterwards , the seven samples were subjected to metallographic preparation that included grinding , polishing and electrolytic etching using 10 % chromic acid with a tension of 2 V tension for 15 s. Metallographic images were acquired using a scanning electron microscope ( SEM ) Philips XL30 ( Oxford Instruments , England ) , and a study of the chemical composition of the secondary phases was carried out through energy dispersive spectroscopy of X-rays ( EDS ) .
After the microstructural analysis , the background echo and backscattered signals were acquired to evaluate the effect of aging on the Inconel 625 alloy samples .
Ultrasound signal acquisitions The pulse echo technique and direct contact method were used to capture the background echo and , backscattered ultrasonic signals ( Schölkopf & Smola , 2002 ) .
All the signals were obtained using commercial NDT ultrasonic transducers : one of 4 MHz ( Krautkramer , Germain , model MB4S ) and another one of 5 MHz ( Krautkramer , Germain , model MSW-QCG ) .
The choice of these transducers was based on the authors previous experience in this kind of NDT and knowledge concerning the materials under study ( Albuquerque et al. , 2010 ; Normando , Moura , Souza , Tavares , & Padovese , 2010 ; Silva et al. , 2009 ) .
In fact , Albuquerque et al. , in Albuquerque et al .
( 2012 ) , showed that these frequencies revealed to be the most adequate to analyze the material under study , as a transducer with a frequency of 10 MHz completely attenuated the ultrasound signal , and one with a frequency of 2.25 MHz led to an adjacent echo that overlapped the signal extensively , seriously compromising the accuracy of the results .
As a coupling material , SAE 15W40 lube oil was used for the longitudinal measurements .
A Krautkramer ultrasound device ( GE Inspection Technologies , USA , model USD15B ) was used connected to a 100 MHz digital oscilloscope ( Tektronix , USA , model TDS3012B ) , which transmitted the ultrasonic signals to a computer for processing , using a sampling rate of 1 GS/s .
Ultrasonic signal preprocessing and classification The microstructural characterization was carried out using OPF , Bayesian , SVM with Radial Basis Function ( RBF ) , linear and polynomial kernels classifiers on the original background echo and backscattered signals .
These signals were also preprocessed using feature extraction techniques based on detrended fluctuation analysis ( DFA ) and Rescaled method ( RS ) , in which a better description of these methods can be found in Albuquerque et al .
( 2012 ) .
In order to assure statistical significance , 40 signals were acquired for each sample and each background echo signal had 10,000 points , i.e. , a total of 400,000 points was attained , and each backscattered signal had 500 points , resulting in a total of 20,000 points for this study .
After signal preprocessing using the DFA and RS techniques , the number of points of the background echo signals was reduced to 1680 , i.e. , a reduction of 42 times , the backscattered signals to 960 points , which means a reduction of 24 times .
Albuquerque et al. , in Albuquerque et al .
( 2012 ) did not consider echo signals without preprocessing , claiming that the large number of points made their use impracticable .
However , this problem has been overcome because the classifiers used in this work are faster and more powerful , which is one of the important contributions attained with this work .
Ultrasound signals classification for the microstructural characterization In order to classify the original and preprocessed ultrasonic signal data , OPF , Bayesian , SVM RBF , SVM linear and SVM polynomial classifiers were employed and compared .
For all classifiers , the training and testing phases were computed using the 10-fold cross validation approach on the same folds .
For comparison purposes , the mean and standard deviation were computed on the results obtained by each classifier .
Optimum path forest classifier The OPF classifier models the problem of pattern recognition as a graph partition in a given feature space .
The nodes are represented by the feature vectors and all pairs are connect by edges , defining a complete graph .
This kind of representation is straightforward , given that the graph does not need to be explicitly represented , and has low memory requirements .
The partition of the graph is carried out by a competition process between some key samples , known as prototypes , which offer optimum paths to the remaining nodes of the graph .
Each prototype sample defines its optimum-path tree ( OPT ) , and the collection of all OPTs defines the optimum-path forest , which gives the name to the classifier ( Papa et al. , 2009 ) .
The OPF can be seen as a generalization of the well known Dijkstra ’ s algorithm to compute optimum paths from a source node to the remaining ones ( Dijkstra , 1959 ) .
The main difference relies on the fact that OPF uses a set of source nodes , i.e. , the prototypes , with any path-cost function .
In case of Dijkstra ’ s algorithm , a function that summed the arc-weights along a path was applied .
For OPF , a function that gives the maximum arc-weight along a path is used ( Papa et al. , 2009 ) .
Let Z = Z1 ∪ Z2 be a dataset labeled with a function λ , in which Z1 and Z2 are , respectively , training and test sets , and let S ⊆ Z1 be a set of prototype samples .
Essentially , the OPF classifier builds a discrete optimal partition of the feature space such that any sample s ∈ Z2 can be classified according to this partition .
This partition is an optimum path forest ( OPF ) computed in by the image foresting transform ( IFT ) algorithm ( Falcão , Stolfi , & Lotufo , 2004 ) .
The OPF algorithm may be used with any smooth path-cost function which can group samples with similar properties ( Falcão et al. , 2004 ) .
This work used the path-cost function fmax , which is computed as : ( 1 ) in which d ( s , t ) means the distance between samples s and t , and a path π is defined as a sequence of adjacent samples .
As such , fmax ( π ) computes the maximum distance between adjacent samples in π , when π is not a trivial path .
The OPF algorithm assigns one optimum path P∗ ( s ) from S to every sample s ∈ Z1 , originating an optimum path forest P ( a function with no cycles which assigns to each s ∈ Z1⧹S its predecessor P ( s ) in P∗ ( s ) or a marker nil when s ∈ S. Let R ( s ) ∈ S be the root of P∗ ( s ) that can be reached from P ( s ) ) .
The OPF algorithm computes for each s ∈ Z1 , the cost C ( s ) of P∗ ( s ) , the label L ( s ) = λ ( R ( s ) ) , and the predecessor P ( s ) .
The OPF classifier is composed of two distinct phases : ( i ) training and ( ii ) classification .
The former step consists , essentially , of finding the prototypes and computing the optimum-path forest , which is the union of all OPTs rooted at each prototype .
After that , a sample is picked from the test sample , which is connect it to all the samples of the optimum-path forest generated in the training phase .
Notice that this test sample is not permanently added to the training set , i.e. , it is used only once .
The next sections describe this procedure in more detail .
Training : We say that S∗ is an optimum set of prototypes when the OPF algorithm minimizes the classification errors for every s ∈ Z1 .
S∗ can be found by exploiting the theoretical relation between the minimum-spanning tree ( MST ) and optimum-path tree for fmax ( Allène , Audibert , Couprie , Cousty , & Keriven , 2007 ) .
The training essentially consists of finding S∗ and an OPF classifier rooted at S∗ .
By computing an MST in the complete graph ( Z1 , A ) , we obtain a connected acyclic graph whose nodes are all samples of Z1 and the arcs are undirected and weighted by the distances d between adjacent samples .
The optimum spanning tree is the tree that has the least sum of its arc compared to any other spanning tree in the complete graph .
In the MST , every pair of samples is connected by a single path that is optimum according to fmax .
That is , the minimum-spanning tree contains one optimum-path tree for any selected root node .
The optimum prototypes are the closest elements of the MST with different labels in Z1 ; i.e. , elements that fall in the frontier of the classes .
By removing the arcs between different classes , their adjacent samples become prototypes in S∗ and OPF can compute an optimum-path forest with minimum classification errors in Z1 .
It should be noted that a given class may be represented by multiple prototypes , i.e. , optimum-path trees , and there must exist at least one prototype per class .
Classification : For any sample t ∈ Z2 , all arcs connecting t with samples s ∈ Z1 are addressed , as though t were part of the training graph .
Considering all possible paths from S∗ to t , the optimum path P∗ ( t ) from S∗ is found and t is labeled with the class λ ( R ( t ) ) of its most strongly connected prototype R ( t ) ∈ S∗ .
This path can be identified incrementally by evaluating the optimum cost C ( t ) as : ( 2 ) Let the node s∗ ∈ Z1 be the one that satisfies Eq ( 2 ) , i.e. , the predecessor P ( t ) in the optimum path P∗ ( t ) .
Given that L ( s∗ ) = λ ( R ( t ) ) , the classification simply assigns L ( s∗ ) as the class of t. An error occurs when L ( s∗ ) ≠ λ ( t ) .
Bayesian classifier Let p ( ωi∣x ) be the probability of a given pattern to belong to class ωi , i = 1 , 2 , … , c , which can be defined by the Bayes Theorem ( Jaynes , 2003 ) : ( 3 ) where p ( x∣ωi ) is the probability density function of the patterns that compose the class ωi , and P ( ωi ) corresponds to the probability of the class ωi itself .
A Bayesian classifier decides whether a pattern x belongs to the class ωi when : ( 4 ) which can be rewritten as follows by using Eq ( 3 ) : ( 5 ) As one can see , the Bayes classifier ’ s decision function di ( x ) = p ( x∣ωi ) P ( ωi ) of a given class ωi strongly depends on the previous knowledge of p ( x∣ωi ) and P ( ωi ) , ∀i = 1,2 , … , c. The probability values of P ( ωi ) are straightforward and can be obtained by calculating the histogram of the classes .
However , the main problem is to find the probability density function p ( x∣ωi ) , given that the only information available is a set of patterns and its corresponding labels .
A common practice is to assume that the probability density functions are Gaussian ones , and thus one can estimate their parameters using the dataset samples ( Duda , Hart , & Stork , 2000 ) .
In the n-dimensional case , a Gaussian density of the patterns from class ωi can be calculated using : ( 6 ) in which μi and Ci correspond to the mean and the covariance matrix of class ωi .
These parameters can be obtained by considering each pattern x that belongs to class ωi using the following equations : ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) in which Ni means the number of samples from class ωi .
Support vector machines classifier One of the fundamental problems of the learning theory can be stated as : given two classes of known objects , assign one of them to a new unknown object .
Thus , the objective in a two-class pattern recognition is to infer a function ( Schölkopf & Smola , 2002 ) : ( 9 ) regarding the input–output of the training data .
Based on the principle of structural risk minimization ( Vapnik , 1999 ) , the SVM optimization process is aimed at establishing a separating function while accomplishing the trade-off that exists between generalization and over fitting .
Vapnik ( 1999 ) considered the class of hyperplanes in some dot product space , ( 10 ) where , corresponding to decision function : ( 11 ) and , based on the following two arguments , the author proposed the Generalized Portrait learning algorithm for problems which are separable by hyperplanes : 1 .
Among all hyperplanes separating the data , there exists a unique optimal hyperplane distinguished by the maximum margin of separation between any training point and the hyperplane ; 2 .
The overfitting of the separating hyperplanes decreases with increasing margin .
Thus , to construct the optimal hyperplane , it is necessary to solve : ( 12 ) subject to : ( 13 ) with the constraint ( 13 ) ensuring that f ( xi ) will be +1 for yi = +1 and −1 for yi = −1 , and also fixing the scale of w. A detailed discussion of these arguments is provided by Schölkopf and Smola ( 2002 ) .
The function τ in ( 12 ) is called the objective function , while in ( 13 ) the functions are the inequality constraints .
Together , they form a so-called constrained optimization problem .
The separating function is then a weighted combination of elements of the training set .
These elements are called support vectors and characterize the boundary between the two classes .
The replacement referred to as the kernel trick ( Schölkopf & Smola , 2002 ) is used to extend the concept of hyperplane classifiers to nonlinear support vector machines .
However , even with the advantage of “ kernelizing ” the problem , the separating hyperplane may still not exist .
In order to allow some examples to violate ( 13 ) , the slack variables ξ ⩾ 0 are introduced ( Schölkopf & Smola , 2002 ) , which leads to the constraints : ( 14 ) A classifier that generalizes efficiently is then found by controlling both the margin ( through ∥w∥ ) and the sum of the slack variables .
As a result , a possible accomplishment of such a soft margin classifier is obtained by minimizing the objective function : ( 15 ) subject to the constraint in ( 14 ) , where the constant C > 0 determines the balance between overfitting and generalization .
Due to the tuning variable C , these kinds of SVM based classifiers are normally referred to as C-Support Vector Classifiers ( C-SVC ) ( Cortes & Vapnik , 1995 ) .
In this section , the experimental results are presented and discussed : first , the classification of the ultrasound signal and its correlation with the material microstructures are addressed , and then the SEM analysis of the Inconel 625 alloy aged samples are evaluated .
Ultrasound signals classification The original ultrasound background echo and backscattered signals and the corresponding preprocessed signals , acquired using 4 and 5 MHz transducers , were classified using OPF with the Euclidian and Manhattan distances , a Bayesian classifier , and also using SVM with linear , polynomial and RBF kernels .
The classification efficiency and speed were compared taking into account the accuracy rates , classification times and confusion matrices .
Thus , it is possible to evaluate the difficulty of the classifiers to separate the microstructural classes correctly .
Then , SEM micrographies were used to evaluate the best results obtained by each classifier .
The execution times were computed in a personal computer with an Intel i7 at 2.8 GHz and 4 Gb of RAM and Linux Ubuntu as the operational system .

For these classifiers , the total processing times were 16.43 , 1.40 and 10,686 ms , respectively , revealing that the OPF was more than 11 times faster than the Bayesian and around 7632 times faster than the SVM classifier , while the difference between the best accuracy rates of the OPF and Bayesian classifiers was only 2.0 % .
Even on the preprocessed signals , the OPF-based classifiers were faster than the Bayesian and SVM classifiers .
Especially in case of the 5 MHz unprocessed background echo signals , the OPF with the Manhattan distance ( 0.77 ms ) was about 336 times faster than Bayesian classifier ( 258.74 ms ) , and more than 323,875 times faster than the fastest SVM-based classifier ( 249,384 ms ) .
The speed-up associated with OPF is due to its classification algorithm , which establishes a very efficient manner of the test sample related to nodes on the graph constructed in the training phase .
This comparison is conducted in a binary heap , organized in a cost decreasing order during the training phase ( Papa , Albuquerque , Falcão , & Tavares , 2012 ) .
When the queue reaches a node , in which the distance to the test sample is higher than the predecessor cost , the algorithm stops the classification prematurely , saving time and returning the result before finishing the heap .
This is done because all the remaining nodes will have a higher cost due to the cost function presented in ( 2 ) , which will not be associated with the test sample .
The confusion matrix for the best classifier regarding the thermal aging at 650 °C is shown in Table 3 .
This table reveals that there are very few classification errors .
The most significant were between the 100 and 10 h classes .
These findings are fully supported by the microstructural analysis that was carried out , since the time period between 0 and 100 h corresponds to the formation and partial dissolution of the Laves phases , and the time period from 100 to 200 h corresponds to the cuboidal precipitation rich in Ti and Nb , i.e. , two microstructure types were involved ( Albuquerque et al. , 2012 ) .
This was expected , since at these stages , the laves and delta-phases are both found on the material samples , due to their incomplete dissolution confirmed by the SEM based evaluation ( 3.2 ) .
For 200 h , these phases were completely dissolved .

In such classifications , the total processing times were equal to 0.77 , 258.74 and 269,132 ms , respectively .
These findings reveal more clearly the superior performance of the OPF-based classifiers in handling datasets that have a large number of features ( in this case , 10,000 for each original set of background echo signals ) .
The OPF classifier obtained the best accuracy rates and was the fastest one , being around 336 times faster than the Bayesian classifier and 349,522 times faster than the SVM classifier .
The confusion matrix for the best classifier regarding the thermal aging at 950 °C is shown in Table 6 .
It is clear that the best classification occurred for the 0h samples , which are very distinct from the other classes , due to the cubic structures in the microstructure and lack of delta phases .
Again , the worst rates refer to the misclassification of 10 and 100 h samples , in which the presence of delta-structures were evident .
The classification of the signals regarding the samples aging for 200 h presented slightly better results due to the complete dissolution of the delta-phases , as confirmed by SEM evaluation ( Section 3.2 ) .

Microstructural SEM analysis and its correlation with ultrasound signal classification The coatings of Inconel 625 alloy deposited by the welding process were submitted to metallographic analysis and SEM , which revealed the Ni-fcc matrix and an extensive amount of secondary phases precipitated ( glowing dots ) at the intercellular or interdendritic regions .
The microstructure of the as-welded alloy condition ( 0 h ) can be seen in Fig 2 .
The figure shows an interdendritic secondary phase and some precipitates with cuboidal morphology .
The microstructures revealed a Ni-fcc matrix ( darkest regions in the image ) with some secondary phases precipitated along the intercellular/interdendritic regions ( whitest regions in the image ) .
These minor phases were identified as Nb-rich Laves phase and a complex carbide/nitride with cubic morphology .

SEM micrographs using secondary electrons showing the Ni-fcc matrix and the secondary phases for the as-welded state – 0 h. Fig 3 ( a–c ) shows the micrographs of the aged samples for 10 , 100 and 200 h , respectively , in which the microstructural modifications can be seen clearly .
Fig 3 ( a ) shows the microstructure corresponding to the sample aged at 650 °C for 10 h , in which one can see the presence of Laves phase and some cuboidal precipitates of carbides/nitrides .
Increasing the time of the thermal exposure to 100 h ( Fig 3 ( b ) ) there was a significant reduction , i.e. , dissolution , in Laves phase content and dimension in the alloy microstructure relatively to the as-welded and 10 h. However , Albuquerque et al .
( 2012 ) verified that the carbide/nitrides that remained seemed to be unaffected , without any sign of dissolution .
As such , quantitatively , there was a larger amount of TiNb carbides/nitrides relative to the Laves phases , which was different to what was seen in the as-welded and 10 h samples ( Albuquerque et al. , 2012 ) .
A representative microstructure of the Inconel 625 alloy sample aged at 650 °C for 200 h is shown in Fig 3 ( c ) .
In this case , the microstructure indicated an almost complete dissolution of the Laves phases , as the microstructure was now almost totally constituted by the TiNb carbides/nitrides and Ni-fcc matrix .
The yet incomplete Laves phase dissolution was evidenced by the residual presence of reminiscent Laves phases ( Albuquerque et al. , 2012 ) .

SEM micrographs using secondary electrons showing the Ni-fcc matrix and the secondary phases of alloy aged at 650 °C for 10 ( a ) , 100 ( b ) and 200 ( c ) h. At the thermal aging temperature of 950 °C , a large number of delta phases were observed in samples aged for 10 h. This phase dissolved exponentially with respect to the aging time , as can be seen in Fig 4 ( a–c ) that show the microstructural evolution of the nickel based weld metal , aged 10 , 100 and 200 h at 950 °C , respectively .
SEM micrographs using secondary electrons showing the Ni-fcc matrix and the… Fig 4 .
SEM micrographs using secondary electrons showing the Ni-fcc matrix and the secondary phases of alloy aged at 950 °C for 10 ( a ) , 100 ( b ) and 200 ( c ) h. After being subjected to a thermal aging at 950 °C for 10 h , the microstructure of the weld metal experienced a significant change .
There was a new type of minor phase and the consumption of the prior secondary phase as shown in Fig 4 ( a ) .
The main change was the formation of a new phase which has a needle-like morphology and is rich in Nb .
According the literature , heating Nb bearing nickel alloys to high temperatures , such as 950 °C , may lead to the formation of the Ni3Nb δ-phases with needle-like morphology , which suggested that the new precipitates formed after 10 h at 950 °C were Ni3Nb δ-phases .
Carrying on the microstructural study through microscopic analysis , there was a strong reduction in terms of needle-like phases for the Ni-based weld metal after 100 h of aging .
Fig 4 ( b ) shows the microstructures associated to this aging condition and a significant decrease in the amount of the secondary phases can be seen clearly .
In addition , many islands with needles-like δ-phases and some cuboidal complex carbides/nitrides rich in Nb and Ti are present .
Prolonging the time of exposure to 200 h ( Fig 4 ( c ) ) there small precipitates with cubic morphology ( carbides/nitrides complex ) and a very thin precipitation along the grain boundaries in the microstructure , most probably M6C and M23C6 carbides , were found ( Silva , Miranda , Farias , Afonso , & Ramirez , 2010 , 2011 ) .
The literature reports that the δ-phase formation in a significant quantity can be harmful to the mechanical properties due to the precipitation of hardening Ni-based alloys ( Krueger , 1989 ) .
Therefore , in the case of Inconel 625 alloy , which is a solid-solution strengthened alloy , the precipitation of the δ-phase is only produced after a long exposure time at high temperatures due to the solid solution supersaturated alloy .
The precipitation of the δ-phase leads to a decrease in ductility ( Shankar , Valsan , Rao , & Mannan , 2001 ) .
Another study showed that the hardness and tensile strength decreased with the increase of aging temperature due to the precipitation and coarsening of the delta phase ( Mathew , Rao , & Mannan , 2004 ) .
This work evaluated the efficiency and accuracy of artificial intelligence techniques to classify ultrasound signals , raw data ( original ) and feature selection methods ( preprocessing ) , background echo and backscattered signals acquired at frequencies of 4 and 5 MHz to characterize , to microstructural characterization the kinetics of phase transformations on a Nb-base alloy , thermally aged at 650 and 950 °C for 10 , 100 and 200 h , as well as in the as-welded condition .
In regard to this work , the following conclusions can be pointed out : ( 1 ) The results revealed that ultrasonic signal classification using recent artificial intelligence techniques , mainly the OPF , Bayesian and SVM classifiers were sensitive to the microstructural changes in the Inconel 625 alloy , and efficient to identify the formation of the secondary phases during the welding process , as well as the phase transformation kinetics due to the different thermal aging times ; ( 2 ) The best accuracy rates for thermal aging at 650 °C were obtained using the Bayesian classifier on the backscattered signals acquired with a 4 MHz transducer ( 93.13 % , in 16.43 ms ) , followed by the OPF with Manhattan distance ( 91.88 % , in 1.40 ms ) and the SVM with polynomial kernel ( 91.88 % , in 10,686 ms ) classifiers .
It is important to point out that the OPF was the fastest classifier in all experiments .
For the thermal aging at 950 °C , the best results were obtained using the OPF with Manhattan distance on the background echo signals acquired with the 5 MHz transducer ( 72.50 % , in 0.77 ms ) , followed by the Bayesian ( 71.25 % , in 258.74 ms ) and the SVM with polynomial kernel ( 64.38 % , in 269,132 ms ) classifiers .
Here , the OPF was much fast than the others , especially considering the large number of features ; ( 3 ) The classification using the OPF classifier allows the use of the raw data signals , due to its robustness and fast processing , eliminating the need for preprocessing , and it has a very high classification accuracy .
( 4 ) It is very important note that DFA and RS feature extraction methods did not have the expected effect on the OPF results ( accuracy , and train and test times ) , once that its performance was not superior to ultrasonic signals classification using raw data ( original ) signals .
This is because of the robustness of the OPF classifier .
However , for others classifiers , the total time was less than the time considering the raw data , and with less accuracy .
Based on the results obtained in accurately classifying the ultrasound signals , it is possible to evaluate the aging conditions to which the Inconel 625 alloy was submitted to .
With the use artificial intelligence techniques and ultrasound non-destructive inspection , it is possible to predict the best moment to carry out maintenance services , reducing costs and maintenance time .
