Precise prediction of stock prices is difficult chiefly because of the many intervening factors .
Unpredictability is particularly notable in the aftermath of the global financial crisis .
Data mining may however be used to discover highly correlated estimation models .
This study looks at artificial neural networks ( ANN ) , decision trees and the hybrid model of ANN and decision trees ( hybrid model ) , the three common algorithm methods used for numerical analysis , to forecast stock prices .
The author compared the stock price forecasting models derived from the three methods , and applied the models on 10 different stocks in 320 data sets in an empirical forecast .
Average accuracy of ANN is 15.31 % , the highest , in terms of match with real market stock prices , followed by decision trees , at 14.06 % ; hybrid model is 13.75 % .
The study also discovers that compared to the other two methods , ANN is a more stable method for predicting stock prices in the volatile post-crisis stock market .
Since mid-2008 , when the collapse of Lehman Brothers led to global economic repercussions , the stock market has been hard hit .
Stock indices fell , and economies went into recession .
More than one year later , stock indices have witnessed sharp fluctuations , especially in new emerging markets .
In addition , globalization has made forecasting of stock prices increasingly difficult ( Albuquerque , Francisco , & Marques , 2008 ; Stock & Watson , 2007 ) .
However , we need to know if the study samples of this period and the results of the forecasts of previous researchers are in line with our expectations .
In addition , among Asian emerging markets , China ’ s economic growth has been the engine spurring on the development of stock markets in the region ; hence the greater volatility of stock prices in these markets .
Thus , we need to attach greater importance to emerging stock markets ( Dutta , Jha , Laha , & Mohan , 2006 ; Fidrmuc & Korhonen , 2009 ) .
The Taiwan stock market , which has close inter-connection with Mainland China , is another example worth observing ( Lai , Fan , Huang , & Chang , 2009 ; Lin & Yeh , 2009 ) .
Many algorithm methods are used to predict stock prices .
Examples are the artificial neural networks ( ANN ) ( Desai & Bharati , 2007 ; Kim & Shin , 2007 ; Pino , Parreno , Gomez , & Priore , 2008 ; Zhu , Wang , Xu , & Li , 2008 ) , Fuzzy ( Khashei , Hejazi , & Bijari , 2008 ; Lee & Kim , 2007 ) , or other statistical or forecasting methods ( Chen , Gou , Guo , & Gao , 2008 ; Hu & He , 2007 ; Ince & Trafalis , 2008 ) .
All these methods attempt to predict stock prices under different market and economic conditions , and of them , ANN has produced rather good outcomes and has been the favourite method for many .
Ou and Wang ( 2009 ) , and Lai et al .
( 2009 ) believe that the decision tree ( DT ) method is good for forecasting stock prices .
Levin and Zahavi ( 2001 ) found that problem-correlation using DT is much clearer than traditional methods .
In fact , DT is a very good forecasting method .
The Bayes ’ Theorem may be used as a basis for scientific forecasts .
However , DT studies have focused on commercial activities ( Aitkenhead , 2008 ; Reyck , Degraeve , & Vandenborre , 2008 ) .
In recent years , there has been a lack of research in the prediction of stock prices using both DT and ANN , and comparing the results of one method against the other .
Most ANN studies have focused on its evolution and improvement ( Ihme , Marsden , & Pitsch , 2008 ; Lin & Yeh , 2009 ; Paliwal & Kumar , 2009 ) , and integrated fuzzy models on the forecasting of stock prices ( Khashei et al. , 2008 ; Lai et al. , 2009 ) .
This study aims to fill the research gap by adopting a broader approach through in-depth empirical studies .
The study adopts a hybrid model , using ANN and DT as the foundation , to forecast stock prices .
Try to find out if this model produces better forecasts of stock prices , compared to the earlier two methods .
Hence , the results of forecasted stock prices using the three abovementioned methods ( ANN , DT and hybrid model ) are compared against each other to find out the differences .
In doing so , we can see if the results of our forecasts match our expectations , and discover the most stable model .
Taiwan began promoting the digital content industry around the year 2000 .
Taiwan consumers were receptive to digital games .
In addition some companies were early investors in Mainland China .
The absence of a language barrier allowed them to have higher overseas revenue ; hence , good performance in stock prices .
However , no stock price index is available for reference for this stock cluster .
Instead , they are classified as “ information software stocks ” .
A stock price index comprises prices of stocks of companies in similar businesses ; hence , price movements of stocks tend to affect one another .
And investors can determine fluctuations against each other of stock prices of companies in relevant clusters from the key constituent indices .
However , an industry stock index may not be available for some industries , especially in emerging stock markets , because of their lack of maturity , and few listings .
As a result , investors ’ can rely only on subjective norms and personal perception , and are unable to achieve better forecasting of stock prices ( Hong , Torous , & Valkanov , 2007 ) .
Hence , to have a better grasp of digital game content stocks in Taiwan , we need to observe the business composition of a company , and based on prior expert consultations , determine if a company is indeed in the business of digital game content .
There is no precise definition for the term “ digital game content stocks ” .
But the term “ digital game stocks ” defined in the Taiwan stock market basically includes manufacturing of games spare parts and components , and online games .
Manufacturing of games spare parts and components does not derive its main income from “ game content ” ; instead , income is generated mainly from the production of parts and components of console games .
Examples of OEM manufacturers of console games are PixArt Imaging , Delta Group , and Genius .
However , digital game stocks of this nature that are mainly stocks of OEM manufacturers are not included in this study .
On the other hand , as summer vacation approaches every year , most investors would think of digital content game stocks along the lines of online games , PC games or arcade games , most of which are either information software or actually contain designed game content .
These are the digital game content companies whose stocks will be studied herein .
The study uses the data mining method to derive actual forecasted stock prices .
Data mining is concerned with the development and applications of algorithms for discovery of a priori unknown relationships .
Han and Kamber ( 2006 , p. 7 ) defines data mining as ‘ ‘ the process of discovering interesting knowledge from large amounts of data stored in databases , data warehouses , or other information repositories ” .
Berry and Linoff ( 1997 ) point out that data mining is the exploration and analysis , by automatic or semi-automatic means , of large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns and rules , and to establish effective models and rules .
Data mining is currently widely used in many applications , as users attempt to discover patterns or predict the future using historical data .
The data mining methods used in this study are mainly ANN and DT in order to derive the most relevant results .
As for the hybrid model , it is developed by integrating the results from ANN and DT analyses , to deduce a new model .
Artificial neural networks Artificial neural networks , or ANN , is a popular prediction tool .
It is a technique that simulates the learning process of biological neural networks , by developing models from extremely complex and non-linear formulae .
By using different variables and assumed parameters , it trains a neural network to perform better analysis and predictions .
ANN has been fruitful in predicting stock prices .
Antonio , Claudio , Manuel , and Nelson ( 1996 ) was 63.3 % accurate in their prediction of the range of rises of San Diego ’ s stock market , and 74.7 % accurate in falls .
When Steiner and Wittkemper ( 1997 ) predicted the European stock market between 1991 and 1997 , the accuracy of their predictions was generally efficient .
When Shachmurove and Witkowska ( 2000 ) compared results using the Ordinary Least Squares method ( OLS ) and ANN , they found ANN a better prediction tool .
Dutta et al .
( 2006 ) predicted the Indian stock market with ANN , and found that the root mean square error ( RMSE ) and mean absolute error ( MAE ) are in line with the expected smallness of error .
Zhu et al .
( 2008 ) forecasted the NASDAQ , DJIA and STI indices , and found the ANN model to have good prediction performance .
Based on previous papers written , there have been good researches and recommendations on the use of ANN as a prediction method for stock prices .
Among the ANN learning models , the back-propagation neural network ( BPN ) is most popular and widely used .
Most users of BPN would have to carry out multiple tests to arrive at a better model .
Hence , there are many methods that help optimize the network and determine parameters .
Multiple , Prune and K-means are highly accurate methods with fast responses , and are often used to train the ANN .
Thus , this study will use BPN as a prediction model of stock prices .
Decision tree Modeled after the structure of a tree , DTs are able to provide a good explanation applicable to the prediction of stock prices , and interpret problems very much according to the principles of mathematical and statistical principles ( Brida & Risso , 2010 ) .
DT is a fairly mature technique which includes models such as C5.0 , C & RT , CHAID , QUEST and ID3 , the difference of which is in the derivations of formula , such as entropy and information gain , to determine the attributes that result in splitting .
However , most decision trees consist of many nodes , which , under certain circumstances , hinder analysis or interpretation of information ( Aitkenhead , 2008 ; Ture , Tokatli , & Kurt , 2009 ) .
The classification and regression trees ( CART or C & RT ) method of Breiman , Friedman , Olshen , and Stone ( 1984 ) generates binary decision trees .
In the real world , the chances of biased binary outcomes are few , but the binary method allows for easy interpretation and analysis ( Ture et al. , 2009 ; Yang et al. , 2003 ) .
Thus , the study uses the binary method in the DT prediction of stock prices , and attempts to deduce a correlated prediction factor .
Data collection and methods By using digital game content stocks in Taiwan as the sample .
In terms of the choice of digital game stocks , the key words “ game stock ” were keyed into the UDNDATA online database to search for information between 1 January 2008 and 31 May 2009 , and game stocks as described in the database were extracted .
Through pre-testing , we interviewed managers of securities companies and investors who traded more than US $ 50,000 in May 2009 .
Hence , every game stock was verified by a total of 30 experts and investors .
We then compiled and screened the results , and selected 10 game stocks as shown in Table 1 .
Table 1 .
Digital content stock corporation .
Stock ID Name of corporation ( 3064 ) Astro ( 3083 ) Chinesegamer ( 3086 ) Wayi ( 3293 ) International Games System ( IGS ) ( 3546 ) UserJoy ( 4415 ) Mega Biotech & Electronics ( 5478 ) Soft-World ( 6111 ) SoftStar ( 6169 ) Interserv ( 6180 ) Gamania The 10 game stocks are traded in the OTC Exchange of Taiwan , and have fairly similar IPO backgrounds .
Daily closing stock prices of each of the 10 stocks were gathered from the Gre Tai Securities Market ( GTSM ) database .
Key information collected includes : daily closing OTC index and the daily closing prices of each stock for the period between 1 July 2008 and 31 June 2009 .
A total of 5229 records were extracted .
The unit cluster for all data ( for each stock and OTC index ) is based on the trading date .
Finally , 249 cases were selected as our data set .
Symbol description To better describe the results of our data analysis , mathematical symbols and alphabetical representations are used for simplification purposes .
The symbols represent the following descriptions : ( Stockid ) : Stock code , a numerical value .
For example , 3064 represents the company Astro .
S ( stockid ) : Current day closing price of a stock .
The opening price of a stock can not be used as the benchmark for inputting or analysis , as it does not represent its previous day ’ s closing price due to uncertainties during the period when the market is closed for trading .
At the same time , comparing the day ’ s closing price with the previous day ’ s closing price provides an indication of the magnitude of any rise or fall .
Hence , the daily closing price is used as the parameter for our analysis .
In addition , when collecting information on stock prices , the day ’ s closing price is treated as the same closing price of the previous day if no real transaction is concluded on that day .
As such , the previous day ’ s closing price is indicated as Sday−1 ( stockid ) .
O : OTC index .
Refers to the current day closing OTC index ; OTC index of the previous day is represented by Oday−1 .
P ( stockid ) : Current day ’ s predicted stock closing price .
PER Prediction error ratio , the absolute value of the sum of the current day ’ s predicted stock closing price divided by the current day ’ s closing price minus 1 .
A smaller ratio indicates a more accurate and better prediction .
Its mathematical formula is shown as follows : ( 1 ) 4.3 .
Experimental procedure Data mining is carried out via SPSS Clementine11.1 , where ANN and C & RT analyses are performed .
SPSS15.0 is then used to develop a regression model .
Prediction analysis is based on three methods , the procedures of each is described as follows : ( i ) Artificial neural networks : ANN is a type of artificial intelligence .
We used a standard three-layer fully connected back-propagation neural network .
Input layer nodes represent the previous day ’ s stock closing prices and the previous day ’ s OTC closing index ( Oday−1 ) .
Output layer nodes represent the current day ’ s stock closing prices .
Supervised learning is used to train the back-propagation neural network , and current day ’ s actual stock prices to correct the model to arrive at a better prediction .
The pruning method is used to train , assuming that hidden layer 1 is 12 , in line with the selection criteria for the basic hidden layer ( input layer + output layer ) /2 ) .
As training progresses , the worst units in the hidden layers and input layer will be pruned , and the final outcome generated will be better than other training methods .
The stopping rule is triggered by selecting the best training mode ( default ) .
After ANN analysis , we observed if the estimated accuracy value is greater than 90 % ; if so , we repeated our observation of the relative importance of inputs .
As the higher the value of the relative importance of inputs represent a higher level of importance , while the values vary with the stock ; hence , to avoid differences in the input variables of the stock prediction model , the values are arranged in order , and the first three values are taken as the independent variables ( X ) for the subsequent models used for predicting the dependent variables ( Y ) of future stock prices .
This study employs the simple regression model using the forced entry method to validate the accuracy of the forecasted stock prices .
( ii ) C & RT : C & RT is used in the prediction tree models .
C & RT does not require a long time to train the model , and its interpretation is comparatively easy to understand .
Binary nodes will be generated from analyzing the C & RT results .
Assuming that the initial binary node ( node 0 ) is X1 , and the parent node further splits into two child nodes ( X2 , X3 ) .
If the tree depth is 2 , there will be X1 , X2 , … , X7 , i.e .
a total of seven significant reference entities .
The study uses these seven reference entities ( X1 , X2 , … , X7 ) as the input variable ( X ) for subsequent prediction models for predicting future stock prices ( Y ) .
However , there may be duplication among these seven reference entities due to different information for the various stocks .
Thus , the final number of input variables ( X ) may not be always the same .
( iii ) Hybrid model : Besides the above two algorithms , the study also proposes a hybrid model to predict stock prices .
The hybrid model does not consist of complex algorithms .
First , it derives prediction models from the original ANN and C & RT models , and carries out union operations on these two models .
As such , the independent variable included in this model ’ s regression equation will be more than the number of independent variables in other algorithm methods .
Where the least number of independent variables exist , the hybrid model may be similar to the original ANN or C & RT models .
Finally , we studied relative prediction performance and absolute prediction performance to see if they match our expectations , so as to verify the accuracy of the model .
Relative predicted results refer mainly to the comparison between the three algorithm methods , to determine which of the algorithm methods produces relatively stable predictions and are closest to the actual stock prices .
Absolute prediction performance refers to the algorithm method , whose predicted outcomes are the most accurate , and which could predict with precision the closing prices of the current day ’ s stock prices .
Artificial neural networks analysis Taking Stock Code 3064 as an example .
Using ANN analysis , we found the estimated accuracy to be 96.58 % , and the relative importance of the top three figures is represented as X1 , X2 , X3 .
Regression model is To enable clearer and easier calculation of the stock prediction model , based on the previous symbolic representations , we re-write the model as : ( refer to Table 2 for the full list ) .

From Table 2 , the estimated accuracy is greater than 95 % , indicating the good fitness from ANN training .
Also , R2 > 0.9 and p < 0.05 applies to all regression models .
Thus , the model may be used for the prediction of stock prices .
C & RT analysis For DT analysis , the tree diagram of each stock is first drawn .
Based on a tree depth of 2 , we obtain seven independent variables X1 , X2 , … , X7 .
After screening the duplicated independent variables , the final regression models are shown in Table 3 .
All models are found with R2 > 0.9 and p > 0.05 , which match our expectations .
In this study , at least two independent variables and not more than four independent variables will be retained .
Among the stocks , the prediction model of ( 3064 ) is the same as the ANN predicted model , which indicates that the hybrid model will be the same .

Hybrid model analysis Finally , the first two models are combined to obtain the new hybrid model ( refer to Table 4 ) .
The hybrid model shows R2 > 0.9 and p < 0.05 .
The ( 3083 ) regression model incorporates more independent variables .
( 3064 ) , ( 3546 ) and ( 6180 ) are the three stocks whose regression models are identical to the original ANN prediction model .
The reason that the regression models for ( 3546 ) and ( 6180 ) are the same as the ANN model is because there are fewer independent variables in the C & RT models .
The hybrid model does not consist of any regression model that is the same as those in the C & RT model .
Although the C & RT model assumes seven independent variables for observation , we found more independent variables for prediction by the ANN model , compared to the C & RT model .

Comparative analysis of performance In the actual prediction of stock prices , observation is done in two parts : relative prediction performance , and absolute prediction performance .
Relative prediction performance looks at the stability of the prediction .
Observation dates are 1 July to 14 August 2009 .
A total of 32 sets of data are used to verify the prediction capability of the model .
Because of the difficulties in delivering 100 % accuracy in predicting the current day ’ s closing stock prices , whether comprising a rise or a fall , we use prediction error ratio ( PER ) to measure the prediction performance .
As the PERs of different stocks differ , and in order to avoid inconsistent measurements , the PER is used to derive the data range , from which , we calculate the 20 % -value closest to the minimum value ( implies prediction is closer to accuracy ) and rate it as “ A ” , values falling between 20 % and 50 % are rated “ B ” , and values greater than 50 % are rated “ C ” .
The more “ A ” ratings there are , the greater the number of accurately predicted values , the greater the stability .
Please refer to Fig 1 for details .
Bar graph of stock price prediction performance ratings Fig 1 .
Bar graph of stock price prediction performance ratings .
According to Fig 1 , ANN outperforms both C & RT ( 97 > 79 ) and the hybrid model ( 97 > 88 ) in terms of overall prediction results .
On the other hand , the hybrid model did better than ANN in terms of stability ( 88 > 79 ) .
The results show that the three models produce clearly different prediction results .
It does not represent absolute prediction performance in Fig 1 .
Hence , we need to calculate the absolute prediction performance , and the closer the prediction error ratio is to zero , the greater the degree of accuracy .
Daily opening prices fluctuate according to the median value of the previous day ’ s closing prices .
Current day ’ s price intervals will see a largest rise or largest fall of 7 % from the median value , which means that the current day ’ s greatest magnitude in price fluctuation could be as high as 14 % , and more than 14 % if compared to the previous day ’ s prices .
The study is based on PER being smaller than 0.02 , i.e .
a valid prediction is when the predicted stock prices differ from the actual stock prices by only 2 % .
The total number of valid predictions divided by the total number of predictions is the actual prediction performance ( refer to Fig 2 ) .
Stock price total prediction accuracy of different methods Fig 2 .
Stock price total prediction accuracy of different methods .
We can therefore deduce that using ANN to predict the closing prices of stocks is more in line with actual stock prices .
A total of 49 data sets are accurately predicted .
Therefore , for ANN , there is a 15.31 % probability that a valid prediction will occur across all samples ; C & RT is 14.06 % ; the hybrid model is 13.75 % .
This is different from prediction stability .
Although the total prediction accuracy for C & RT and the hybrid model differs only by 1 , compared to the hybrid model , C & RT produces a more even rating distribution among the 10 sample stocks .
Hence , we believe that prediction accuracy is better for C & RT than the hybrid model .
Between the three models , ANN demonstrates the greatest stability and accuracy at predicting stock prices during the post-crisis period .
And although C & RT is less stable than the hybrid model , it is more accurate .
The hybrid model proposed by the study clearly produces different prediction results .
This implies that integrated use of C & RT and ANN require improved efficiency and further development and more in-depth study is necessary .
By simply using the closing prices of stocks , the study has managed to discover stocks with good investment value .
However , the ever-changing market also implies a broad spectrum of impact factors .
In terms of stock analysis , data mining is an effective tool for discovering the correlation between stocks of a different cluster , so as to provide investors with a simple method for predicting stock prices .
For future studies , other stock selection criteria may be included , and when combined with the characteristics of the relevant algorithm methods , we could develop the most appropriate prediction criteria .
However , although predicted stock prices may be used as a reference , they are not the main deciding factors .
Prudent investment decisions must be supported by a company ’ s financial statements .
There are some limitations to the study : first , samples collected are for the period of July 2008–June 2009 ( one year ) .
However , this is not a complete fiscal year , and the time period is relatively short .
Nonetheless , it may be viewed as a full business cycle .
Inclusion of stock prices of the past 3–5 years would upset the original sample .
On the contrary , during the period of data collection , the stock market exhibited fairly large fluctuations .
Difficulty of predictability also implies more meaningful results .
Secondly , in verifying the models ’ performance , we used 32 days as the actual verification period for accuracy .
We took into consideration the impact of the market ’ s movements on the changes to the prediction models , and that the original prediction model might lose its predictive ability .
Thirdly , the samples were digital content stocks .
The high correlation between companies ’ businesses results in a rather high R2 value .
If all OTC stocks were used as input factors for our prediction , R2 would have been lower .
Also , different stock markets may result in different outcomes .
