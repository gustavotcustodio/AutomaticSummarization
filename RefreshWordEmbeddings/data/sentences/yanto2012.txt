Computational models of the artificial intelligence such as rough set theory have several applications .
Data clustering under rough set theory can be considered as a technique for medical decision making .
One possible application is the clustering of student suffering study ’ s anxiety .
In this paper , we present the applicability of variable precision rough set model for clustering student suffering studies anxiety .
The proposed technique is based on the mean of accuracy of approximation using variable precision of attributes .
The datasets are taken from a survey aimed to identify of studies anxiety sources among students at Universiti Malaysia Pahang ( UMP ) .
At this stage of the research , we show how variable precision rough set model can be used to groups student in each study ’ s anxiety .
The results may potentially contribute to give a recommendation how to design intervention , to conduct a treatment in order to reduce anxiety and further to improve student ’ s academic performance .
The studies anxiety is situation that refers to anxiety condition during study in term of the perception that high level anxiety relate to obtain of low academic performance .
The sources can create as well increased students ’ anxiety levels while study process , its make students have bad experience then they will keep the experience for next situations .
Such anxiety can interfere with students ’ performance on exam ( Harris & Coy , 2003 ; McCraty , 2003 ) .
According to Spielberger in Sansgiry and Kavita ( 2006 ) found that exam anxiety as a situation-specific trait that refers to the anxiety states and worry conditions that are experienced during examinations .
Too much anxiety can interrupt exam performance , researchers have been investigated that exam anxiety mostly to negative effect on academic performance ( Sansgiry & Kavita , 2006 ) .
High degree of anxiety can block thoughts , create negative frame in mind , and potential of poor exam performance .
Researcher report that student who is not well prepared for exam may have higher levels of task interfering worry during examination than those are better prepared ( Pecoraro , 2006 ) .
The traditional main objectives of grouping student suffering study ’ anxiety are to deal with the uncertainty due to design intervention , to conduct a treatment to reduce anxiety and further to improve student ’ s academic performance .
To achieve this objective , certain clustering techniques are also being applied .
Clustering a set of objects into homogeneous classes is an important Data mining operation .
The clustering operation is required in a number of data analysis tasks , such as unsupervised classification and data summation , as well as segmentation of large homogeneous data sets into smaller homogeneous subsets that can be easily managed , separately modeled and analyzed ( Huang , 1998 ) .
A well-known approach for data clustering is using rough set theory ( Pawlak , 1982 , 1991 ; Pawlak & Skowron , 2007 ) .
For example , Mazlack , He , Zhu , and Coppock ( 2000 ) had developed a rough set approach in choosing partitioning attributes .
One of the successful pioneering rough clustering for categorical data techniques is Minimum–Minimum Roughness ( MMR ) proposed by Parmar , Wu , and Blackhurst ( 2007 ) .
However , pure rough set theory is not well suited for analyzing noisy information systems .
As there is little support by commercial DBMSs to reduce errors that occur during data-entry and there is virtually nothing that a DBMS can do to catch errors that occur during the collection process , noise is prevailing in real-world applications and comes from many sources , including erroneous attribute values in samples and/or erroneous classification of samples to wrong classes .
A knowledge discovery system must be tolerant to the occurrence of noise .
For example , in the previous work on constructing student models through mining students classification-test answer sheets by Wang and Hung ( 2001 ) , much noise was found in the classification tables , either the feature values or the class values , created by students .
Some of the noises might come from the students erroneous inputs and the others might be due to the students internal inconsistent believes .
Their empirical results showed that attention should be paid to handle the noisy information in order to reach a satisfactory prediction accuracy ( Wang , 2005 ) .
In order to overcome this issue , the variable precision rough set ( VPRS ) ( Ziarko , 1991 , 2002 ) technique is used .
The VPRS model , firstly proposed by Ziarko ( 1991 ) , is an effective mathematical tool with an error-tolerance capability to handle uncertainty problem .
Basically , the VPRS is an extension of Pawlaks rough set theory ( Pawlak , 1982 , 1991 ; Pawlak & Skowron , 2007 ) , allowing for partial classification .
By setting a confidence threshold value β , the VPRS can not only solve classification problems with uncertain data and no functional relationship between attributes , but also relax the rigid boundary definition of Pawlaks rough set model to improve the model suitability .
Due to the existence of β , the VPRS can resist data noise or remove data errors ( Slezak & Ziarko , 2005 ) .
In order to determine a rational change interval for β ( Xie , Zhang , Lai , & Yu , 2008 ) , It will give us a new way to deal with the noisy data .
We present a real dataset of student ’ s suffering anxiety .
This data were taken from a survey aimed to identify of study anxiety sources among university students .
In this survey , 770 Universiti Malaysia Pahang ’ s students are involved and asked about experiences , feels , and thoughts of anxiety during study process .
The results identify seven anxiety ’ s sources , i.e. , mathematic anxiety , language anxiety , family anxiety , library anxiety , exam anxiety , presentation anxiety , and social anxiety .
Descriptive statistics is used to find out the Mean ( M ) and Standard Deviation ( SD ) to identify the five potential sources of study anxiety .
It is ran in SPSS version 16.0 and the results show that there are five potential sources of study anxiety , i.e. , exam anxiety , class presentation anxiety , mathematic anxiety , language anxiety and social anxiety .
Using Variable Precision Rough Set Model , we present how student suffering anxiety can be grouped .
Grouping of such student may potentially contribute to give a recommendation how to design intervention , to conduct a treatment in order to reduce anxiety and further to improve student ’ s academic performance .
The rest of this paper is organized as follows .
Section 2 describes the notion of information systems , set approximations and variable precision rough set model .
Section 3 describes VPRS model for selecting a clustering attribute in data clustering and the technique for grouping the objects based on the attribute selected .
Section 4 describes the study ’ s anxiety datasets .
The results and visualization are obtained in Section 5 .
Finally , the conclusion of this work is described in Section 6 .
The observation that one can not distinguish objects on the basis of given information about them is the starting point of rough set theory .
In other words , imperfect information causes indiscernibility of objects .
The indiscernibility relation induces an approximation space made of equivalence classes of indiscernible objects .
A rough approximating a subset of the set of objects is a pair of dual set approximations , called a lower and an upper approximation in term of these equivalence classes ( Pawlak , 1982 ) .
Rough sets are defined through their dual set approximations in an information system .
The notion of information system provides a convenient tool for the representation of objects in terms of their attribute values .
Information system and set approximations An information system is a 4-tuple ( quadruple ) S = ( U , A , V , f ) , where U = { u1 , u2 , u3 , … , u∣U∣ } is a non-empty finite set of objects , A = { a1 , a2 , a3 , … , a∣A∣ } is a non-empty finite set of attributes , V = ∪ a∈AVa , Va is the domain ( value set ) of attribute a , f : U × A → V is an information function such that f ( u , a ) ∈ Va , for every ( u , a ) ∈ U × A , called information ( knowledge ) function .
The starting point of rough set approximations is the indiscernibility relation , which is generated by information about objects of interest .
Two objects in an information system are called indiscernible ( indistinguishable or similar ) if they have the same feature .
Definition 2.1 Two elements x , y ∈ U are said to be B-indiscernible ( indiscernible by the set of attribute B ⊆ A in S ) if and only if f ( x , a ) = f ( y , a ) , for every a ∈ B .
Obviously , every subset of A induces unique indiscernibility relation .
Notice that , an indiscernibility relation induced by the set of attribute B , denoted by IND ( B ) , is an equivalence relation .
The partition of U induced by IND ( B ) is denoted by U/B and the equivalence class in the partition U/B containing x ∈ U , in denoted by [ x ] B .
The notions of lower and upper approximations of a set are defined as follows .
Definition 2.2 See Ziarko , 2002 The B-lower approximation of X , denoted by B ( X ) and B-upper approximation of X , denoted by , respectively , are defined by B ( X ) = { x ∈ U∣ [ x ] B ⊆ X } and .
The accuracy of approximation ( accuracy of roughness ) of any subset X ⊆ U with respect to B ⊆ A , denoted αB ( X ) is measured by where ∣X∣ is the cardinality of X .
For empty set ϕ , we define αB ( ϕ ) = 1 .
Obviously , 0 ⩽ αB ( X ) ⩽ 1 if X is a union of some equivalence classes of U , then αB ( X ) = 1 .
Thus , the set X is crisp ( precise ) with respect to B .
And , if X is not a union of some equivalence classes of U , then αB ( X ) < 1 .
Thus , the set X is rough ( imprecise ) with respect to B .
This means that the higher of accuracy of approximation of any subset X ⊆ U is the more precise ( the less imprecise ) of itself .
While , The original Pawlak ’ s formulations lower and upper approximation are based on the set inclusion and set overlap operators respectively ( Pawlak , 1982 ) .
Although , it is sufficient in many applications , there are situations in which the original , set inclusion operator-based formulation of lower and upper is too restrictive .
To deal with this problem , the more relaxed formulation of lower and upper approximations in terms of controlled degree of overlap between sets rather than the inclusion relation was introduced in Ziarko ( 1991 ) in the context of the variable precision rough set ( Ziarko , 2002 ) .
Variable precision rough set Variable precision rough set ( VPRS ) extends rough set theory by the relaxation of the subset operator ( Ziarko , 1991 ) .
It was proposed to analyze and identify data patterns which represent statistical trends rather than functional .
The main idea of VPRS is to allow objects to be classified with an error smaller than a certain pre-defined level .
This introduced threshold relaxes the rough set notion of requiring no information outside the dataset itself .
Definition 2.3 Let a set U as a universe and X , Y ⊆ U , where X , Y ≠ ϕ .
The error classification rate of X relative to Y is denoted by e ( X , Y ) , is defined by Definition 2.4 Let U be a finite set and let β be a real number within the range 0 ⩽ β < 0.5 and a set X ⊆ U .
The Bβ-lower approximation of X , denoted by Bβ ( X ) and Bβ-upper approximation of X , denoted by , respectively , are defined by The set Bβ ( X ) is called the positive region of X. It ’ s the set of object of U that can be classified into X with error classification rate not greater than β .
Then we have if only if 0 ⩽ β < 0.5 , which means that be restricted in an interval [ 0 , 0.5 ) in order to keep the meaning of the “ upper ” and “ lower ” approximations .
In this section , we will present the proposed technique , which we refer to as Maximum Accuracy of Variable Precision Rough Set .
The technique uses the accuracy of approximation using variable precision of attributes in the rough set theory .
The accuracy of approximation using variable precision of attributes is higher than stranded approximation for selecting clustering attribute .
Proposition 3.1 prove that the accuracy of approximation using variable precision of attributes is more accurate for selecting clustering attribute .
Definition 3.1 The accuracy of approximation variable precision ( accuracy of variable precision roughness ) of any subset X ⊆ U with respect to B ⊆ A is denoted by .
It is presented as where ∣X∣ denotes cardinality of X .
If β = 0 , it is the traditional rough set model of Pawlak .
Proposition 3.1 Let S = ( U , A , V , f ) be an information system , αB ( X ) be an accuracy of roughness and is an accuracy of variable precision roughness given the error factor of variable precision .
.
Proof Based on Definition 2.4 , if β ⩾ 0.5 , then .
Thus , for 0 ⩽ β < 0.5 , we have B0 ( X ) ⊇ Bβ ( X ) and .
Consequently , ∣B0 ( X ) ∣ ⩽ ∣Bβ ( X ) ∣ and .
For β = 0 , based on Definition 3.1 , .
For 0 < β < 0.5 , we have ∣B0 ( X ) ∣ ⩽ ∣Bβ ( X ) ∣ and .
Hence Therefore , .
□ Definition 3.2 Suppose ai ∈ A , V ( ai ) has k-different values , say γk , k = 1 , 2 , … , n. Let X ( ai = γk ) , k = 1 , 2 , … , n be a subset of the objects having k-different values of attribute ai .
Lets any β be an error factor .
The accuracy of the set X ( ai = γk ) , k = 1 , 2 , … , n , with respect to aj , where i ≠ j , denoted , is defined by ( 1 ) The mean accuracy of attribute ai ∈ A with respect to aj ∈ A , where i ≠ j , denoted by , is evaluated as follows ( 2 ) where V ( ai ) is the set of values of attribute ai ∈ A .
Definition 3.3 Given n attributes , mean variable precision roughness of attribute ai ∈ A with respect to aj ∈ A , where i ≠ j , refers to the mean of , denoted MA ( ai ) , is obtained by the following formula ( 3 ) Fig 1 shows the pseudo-code of the proposed technique .
Suppose that in an information system , there are n objects , m attributes and l is the maximum of distinct values of each attribute .
The VPRS needs nm computation for determining elementary set of all attribute .
The computation of calculating error classifications all subsets of U having different value of attribute ai and mean accuracy of attribute ai with respect to all aj , where i ≠ j is n2l .
The computation of calculating mean variable precision roughness of all attributes is n times .
Thus , the computational complexity of VPRS is of the polynomial ○ ( n2l + mn + n ) .
Example The Table 1 is an information system of student ’ s enrollment qualification containing 8 students with 5 categorical-valued attributes ; Degree , English , Statistics , Programming and Mathematics .

Advance Yes Fluent Fluent There is no a pre-defined a clustering ( decision ) attribute .
Then , we will select a clustering attribute among all candidates .
To obtain the values of VPRS , firstly , we must obtain the equivalence classes induced by indisceribility relation of singleton attribute .
The five partitions of objects from Table 1 are shown as follow .
a. X ( Degree = B.Sc . )
= { 1 , 2 } , X ( Degree = M.Sc . )
= { 3 , 4 , 8 } , X ( Degree = Ph.D. ) = { 5 , 6 , 7 } , b. X ( English = low ) = { 1 , 5 } , X ( English = intermediate ) = { 2 , 4 } , X ( English = advance ) = { 3 , 6 , 7 , 8 } , c. X ( Statistics = no ) = { 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 } , X ( Statistics = yes ) = { 2 , 5 , 7 , 8 } , d. X ( Programming = fluent ) = { 1 , 4 , 7 , 8 } , X ( Programming = poor ) = { 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 } , e. X ( Mathematics = poor ) = { 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 } , X ( Mathematics = fluent ) = { 2 , 5 , 6 , 8 } , Based on Definition 2.3 , the error classification attribute Statistics with respect to Degree are calculated as follow .
By given β = 0.4 , the Bβ-lower and Bβ-upper approximations are The mean accuracy of attribute Statistics with respect to Degree are Following the same procedure , the mean accuracy on all attributes with respect each to the other are computed .
These calculations are summarized in Table 2 .

Thus , attribute Mathematics is selected as a clustering attribute .
For objects splitting , we use a divide-conquer method .
We can cluster ( partition ) the objects based on the decision attribute selected , i.e. , Mathematics .
Notice that , the partition of the set of objects induced by attribute Mathematics is U/Mathematics = { { 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 } , { 2 , 5 , 6 , 8 } } .
To this , we can split the objects into two cluster as the first cluster { 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 } and second cluster { 2 , 5 , 6 , 8 } .
