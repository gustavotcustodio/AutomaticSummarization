This paper presents an artificial neural network approach for locating internal faults in salient-pole synchronous generator .
This method uses samples of magnetic flux linkages to reach a decision .
Meyer wavelet probabilistic neural network ( MWPNN ) as main part of this fault diagnosis method is utilized to detect internal faults .
The basic PNN is integrated with discrete wavelet transform ( DWT ) to construct the MWPNN .
The MWPNN is trained by features extracted from the magnetic flux linkage data through the discrete wavelet transform ( DWT ) .
To implement this method practically , the training database for the PNN is generated by 3D-FEM .
Since the FEM simulation is a time-consuming process , hence in order to reduce the number of FEM computations generalized regression neural network ( GRNN ) is used to estimate the flux linkages characteristics of synchronous generator under various conditions .
The diagnosis performance of the proposed method is validated via experimental data , derived from a 4-pole , 380 V , 1500 rpm , 50 Hz , 50 KVA , 3-phase salient-pole synchronous generator .
Fault detection of electrical machines has moved in recent years from conventional techniques to Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) techniques ( Lei , He , & Zi , 2008 ; Negrea , 2007 ; Wang , Kang , Shen , Chang , & Chung , 2010 ) .
AI-based techniques have the potential advantage over conventional methods in significantly improving the accuracy in fault detection .
This is so by virtue of the fact that ANNs have the ability of non-linear mapping , parallel processing and learning ( Joorabian , Taleghani , & Aggarwal , 2004 ) ; these features make them ideally suited for providing a high accuracy in fault detection under a wide variety of different systems and fault conditions .
The AI techniques have many advantages over conventional fault diagnostic methods ; in addition giving better performance , these techniques are simple to extend and modify , and can be made adaptive by the integration of new data or information ( Negrea , 2007 ) .
AI techniques are now being increasingly used for condition monitoring and fault detection of electrical machines ( Nandi , Toliyat , & Li , 2005 ; Singh & Al Kazzaz , 2003 ) .
Also , several papers have presented different methodologies based on the inclusion of expert systems to classification of power quality disturbances , transformer faults and significant events with probabilistic neural network ( Gerbec , Gasperic , Smon , & Gubina , 2005 ; Karthikeyan , Gopal , & Venkatesh , 2008 ; Liang , Sun , Liu , & Sun , 2007 ; Mishra , Bhende , & Panigrahi , 2008 ; Tang , Goulermas , Wu , Richardson , & Fitch , 2008 ; Tripathy , Maheshwari , & Verma , 2007 ; Wu , Chiang , Chang , & Shiao , 2008 ; Wu & Liu , 2009 ; Yang , Shan , & Zhao , 2006 ) .
On the other hand , synchronous generators are basic and significant elements of power systems and their failure can cause severe damage to the machine , interruption of electrical supply and pursuing economic loss .
Hence , this paper describes the design and implementation of an artificial neural networks-based fault locator for salient-pole synchronous generator .
The technique uses radial basis function ( RBF ) neural networks for locating internal faults in salient-pole synchronous generator .
This locator utilizes magnetic flux linkage waveforms of the fault data .
These values are stored as waveform samples by a designed data recorder .
Then the faulted waveform samples are transferred to a standard personal computer ( PC ) .
The incoming data after processing in PC is fed to the trained ANNs for locating internal faults .
The RBF networks are trained with data under a variety of fault conditions and used for fault location .
Meyer wavelet probabilistic neural network as main part of this fault diagnosis method is utilized to determine internal faults .
The basic PNN is integrated with discrete wavelet transform ( DWT ) to construct the MWPNN .
The MWPNN is trained by features extracted from the magnetic flux linkage data through the discrete wavelet transform .
In fact , the DWT technique and basic probabilistic neural network are combined effectively to construct the classifier .
To implement this method practically , the training database for the MWPNN is generated by 3D-FEM .
Since the FEM simulation is a time-consuming process , hence in order to reduce the number of FEM computations generalized regression neural network was used to estimate the flux linkages characteristics of synchronous generator under various conditions .
The advantage of this method is the best understanding of the local phenomena ( magnetic flux linkage ) and high accuracy of detection .
Radial basis network Probabilistic neural networks ( PNN ) and generalized regression neural network ( GRNN ) belong to the family of radial basis function neural networks ( RBF ) ( Picton , 2000 ) .
PNNs are a kind of radial basis network suitable for classification problems while GRNNs are a kind of radial basis network that is often used for function approximation ( Picton , 2000 ) .
PNN and GRNN have analogous constructions , but there is a basic distinction : PNN make classification where the goal variable is definite , whereas GRNN make regression where the goal variable is continuous ( Picton , 2000 ) .
The PNN and GRNN structures are shown in Fig 1 ( Picton , 2000 ) .
The structure of PNN/GRNN networks consists of four layers , an input layer , a hidden layer , a summation layer and an output layer ( Picton , 2000 ) .
The neural networks structure ( Picton , 2000 ) Fig 1 .
The neural networks structure ( Picton , 2000 ) .
( a ) PNN .
( b ) GRNN .
The input-layer neurons do not perform any computation and merely distribute input features to all the neurons in the hidden layer .
The hidden layer is fully connected to the input layer .
This layer has one neuron for each pattern in the training data set .
When an input is presented , the hidden layer computes distances from the input vector to the training input vectors and produces a vector whose elements indicate how close the input is to a training input .
The summation layer ( pattern layer ) in the network is different for PNN and GRNN networks .
For PNN networks there is one pattern neuron for each class .
The aim class of each training case is stored with each hidden neuron ; the weighted value coming out of a hidden neuron is fed only to the pattern neuron that correlates to the hidden neuron ’ s class .
In fact this layer sums contributions for each class of inputs to produce as its net output a vector of probabilities .
Neurons in the pattern layer utilize multi-dimensional kernels to estimate the probability density function for classification .
One of the most popular kernels is Gaussian function since it guarantees the convergence of the neural network .
For GRNN networks , there are two neurons in the summation layer .
One neuron is the denominator summation unit the other is the numerator summation unit .
The denominator summation unit adds together the weight values coming from every of the hidden neurons .
The numerator summation unit adds together the weight values multiplied by the aim value for every hidden neuron .
The decision layer is different for PNN and GRNN networks .
For PNN networks , the decision layer is a competition layer .
Compete transfer function in this layer picks the maximum of these probabilities , and produces a 1 for that class and a 0 for the other classes .
For GRNN , the decision layer divides the value gathered in the numerator summation unit by the value in the denominator summation unit and utilizes the consequence as the forecasted aim value ( Picton , 2000 ) .
The basic idea behind the PNN is a direct neural network implementation by using the Parzen nonparametric probability density function ( PDF ) estimation and Bayes strategy for pattern classification .
The Parzen estimation of the PDF for class k is ( Picton , 2000 ) ( 1 ) where xkj is the jth training sample from class k , x is unknown input , n is dimension number of classifying vector x , pk is the number of training sample of class k , and the σ is an adjustable smoothing parameter .
Wavelet decomposition The Fourier transform is the most well known mathematical tool used for obtaining the frequency spectrum of a signal .
This transform reveals the magnitude of each frequency component in the signal .
But , it has an important drawback represented by the loss of time information when transforming the signal to the frequency domain ( Hu , Li , & Zhao , 2007 ) .
The wavelet transform can overcome the above limitation , and can represent what spectral components occur at what time instant .
The major advantage of the wavelet transform is that it provides great time and frequency localization whereas Fourier techniques can not simultaneously achieve good localization in both time and frequency for a signal .
In other words , in wavelet transform the size of analysis window varies in proportion to the frequency ( Gaing , 2004 ; Hu et al. , 2007 ; Yang et al. , 2006 ) .
In this paper , discrete wavelet transform ( DWT ) has been used in algorithm of the proposed method .
Discrete approximation of Meyer wavelet is used as the mother wavelet and the magnetic flux linkage of the stator teeth signals are decomposed up to four levels .
The reasons for using radial basis networks and discrete wavelet decomposition Our preference of radial basis networks over other artificial neural networks is attributed to the following main features ( Gaing , 2004 ; Mishra et al. , 2008 ; Picton , 2000 ; Tang et al. , 2008 ; Tripathy et al. , 2007 ) .
• PNN/GRNN learns instantaneously in one-pass through the patterns of the training set which causes these networks faster to train , compared to other neural networks .
• The fast learning speed of the PNN , making it suitable for fault diagnosis and signal classification problems in real time ( especially when implemented on hardware systems ) .
• An inherently parallel structure .
• These networks don ’ t need to pre-decision for the number of layers and hidden units .
• A PNN is guaranteed to converge to a Bayesian classifier provided that it is given enough training data .
• No need to set the initial weights of the network .
• No relationship between learning processes and recalling processes .
• Quick repeated iterative process and superior adaptation capability for architectural changes .
On the other hand , in this project , by regarding to simultaneously sampling data in specific angular position of the rotor ( will be discussed ) , time axis has been replaced with angle axis .
Hence , due to weakness of Fourier transform in reveal the amplitude of magnetic flux linkage of the stator teeth in the time axis ( in this project , instead of time , the angle is presented ) , discrete wavelet transform was used .
The discrete wavelet transform can represent what magnetic flux linkage of the stator teeth occur at what time instant ( in this project , different angle ( θ1 , θ2 , … , θ48 ) .
In addition , discrete wavelet transform is also used for de-noising .
Because by reducing the noise , better network training is done .
Description of the internal faults Undetected turn-to-turn faults lead to generated heat in the deformed region of a winding which finally grow and are changed into phase-to-ground or phase-to-phase faults ( Nandi et al. , 2005 ; Singh & Al Kazzaz , 2003 ) .
These types of faults are a major reason of the stator winding failures and other faults may result from these faults ( Nandi et al. , 2005 ; Singh & Al Kazzaz , 2003 ) .
Therefore , it is very important to analyze and detect the inter-turn winding faults .
Hence , reliable and accurate diagnosis of inter-turn short circuit faults are challenging problem in the area of fault diagnosis of electrical machines .
Fig 2 illustrates the case when a turn-to-turn short circuit has happened in the same branch between two points , m and n. It is evident that the path to the circulating current between these points is closed and the path A–A′ can be extended into two separate circuits .
Also Fig 2 shows the two currents produce opposite MMFs , one of which is the phase current and the other one is short circuit current .
The difference between these two currents is defined as circulating current Icir .
Therefore , the main effect of the inter-turn short circuits is decreasing the MMF close to the short-circuited turns .
Firstly , when a short circuit occurs , the number of phase winding turns and MMF produced by this winding reduce .
Secondly , the MMF produced by short-circuit current is contrary to the MMF produced by phase winding ( Joksimovic & Penman , 2000 ; Negrea , 2007 ) .
Inter-turn short circuit between two points , m and n ( Negrea , 2007 ) Fig 2 .
Inter-turn short circuit between two points , m and n ( Negrea , 2007 ) .
In Fig 2 , ND corresponds to the winding turns being shorted due to turn-to-turn short circuit in the same branch and RD corresponds to the contact resistance .
In the case of turn-to-turn short circuit in the same branch , presented in Fig 2 , the stator winding is divided into three sections , e , f , and g. Because the same current flows through two sections e and g , the voltages across them can be merged into one term .
In fact , the combination of two sections e and g refers to those turns of the stator winding not involved in the inter-turn short circuit fault .
When inter-turn short circuit occurs , the shorted turn will act as the secondary winding of an autotransformer .
Consequently , a very large circulating current will flow in the faulted turn .
This circulating current causes excessive heat and high magnetic forces in machine ( Stone , Boulter , Culbert , & Dhirani , 2004 ) .
The amplitude of the fault current , iD , depends on the fault resistance , RD , and the induced voltage , vsc , in the shorted coil .
In condition that insulation ruin is an occurrence over a long time period at relatively slow rates of breakdown , iD can be expressed as follows ( Ahmed et al. , 2006 ) : ( 2 ) In addition , for frequencies fewer than 10 kHz , the voltage gradient from turn to turn is constant and therefore the voltage is approximately distributed uniformly across the turns of the phase winding ( Ahmed et al. , 2006 ) .
Moreover , for a winding factor , ( Ahmed et al. , 2006 ; Fitzgerald , Kingsley , & Umans , 2003 ) , approximately equal to one , the voltage in the shorted turns can be expressed as follows : ( 3 ) Hence , the fault current can be stated as follows : ( 4 ) This induced voltage , vsc , correspondingly depends on the number of shorted turns , ND , that is associated with this shorted portion of the faulty phase winding in the machine .
Loss of symmetry conditions In electrical machines , air-gap magnetic field distribution in no-load and on-load performance under healthy conditions is symmetrical ( neglecting the insignificant inherent asymmetry in the magnetic field distribution due to the differences on mechanical structures ) .
In a p poles , healthy , symmetrical machine , the magnetic axis of each pole is located at 360/p geometrical degrees ( Cabanas et al. , 2005 ) .
Under load conditions , the pole axis is not an axis of symmetry whereas in no-load conditions the pole axis is axis of symmetry .
In fact when a generator is delivering power to a load , the axes of symmetry of the magnetic field leave from the polar and interpolar axes ( Chari , 1974 ) .
But this symmetry is specially lost under internal faults occurrence .
Therefore , magnetic field distribution could be applied for the early detection of the internal faults in electrical machines .
When an inter-turn winding fault occurs , the fault will cause changes to the machine flux linkages .
For instance , Fig 3 ( a ) and ( b ) shows the distribution of magnetic field density under normal and inter-turn short circuit in stator winding of a mentioned salient-pole synchronous generator using FEM simulations .
Distribution of magnetic field density in salient-pole synchronous generator Fig 3 .

( b ) Under inter-turn short circuit in stator winding .
In this figure , loss of symmetry in the magnetic field distribution during inter-turn fault is presented .
In this research , the magnetic field distribution is calculated by 3D-FEM using ANSYS workbench software .
In the FEM modeling , enclosure feature in ANSYS workbench software supports symmetry models .
A symmetry model may contain up to three symmetry planes ( x–y , x–z , and z–y ) .
In this work , the magnetic field distribution over the complete cross-section of the mentioned generator must be calculated because there are no symmetry conditions in z–x and y–z plans .
But the analyzed model has symmetry conditions in x–y plan .
Hence , in order to reduce the FEM computation time , slice by x–y plane option is used in these simulations ( see Fig 3 ) .
Experimental test Setup , implementation of faults and numerical measurement The machine used in this study is a 50 KVA , 380 V , 4-pole , 1500 rpm , 50 Hz , salient-pole synchronous generator , and machine having 48 stator slots .
The stator of this generator has a 3-phase , one layer , lap winding , and four parallel branches in each phase .
Testing laboratory and experimental test setup are shown in Fig 4 .
It consists of a synchronous generator connected to a three-phase resistive load .
This generator has no damper winding , and is driven by an induction machine .
In our work power factor is one duo to a three-phase resistive load .
Testing laboratory and experimental test setup Fig 4 .
Testing laboratory and experimental test setup .
A no-load experiment and a three-phase symmetrical terminal short-circuit experiment are accomplished on the machine without internal faults .
Next , under low excitation condition , several of internal faults including stator turn-to-turn short circuit in the same branch and two branches in the same phase , were performed on the mentioned generator under on-load and no-load conditions in the laboratory test system .
In these experiments , any resistor to limit the currents is not used .
Also , in order to prevent severe damage to the generator , the duration of the inter-turn short circuit was limited by using a switch .
However , because of the major concern about test machine health for further tests , measurements at full excitation current were not carried out .
In experiments , search coils and designed electronic-microcontroller board are used for measuring the flux linkages from inside the machine .
Electronic-microcontroller board has one master and 48 slaves ( see Fig 4 ) .
Sampled voltage data taken from search coils are directly proportional to the rate of change of the flux .
Forty-eight single turn search coils were installed along the grooves of the stator teeth with a pitch of 15° with the aim of being able to determine how the flux linkage distribution in the generator changes when a fault is present .
Experiment view of these search coils is illustrated in Fig 5 ( a ) .

( b ) Forty-eight input data to neural network are obtained from stator teeth in different angle .
The EMF induced in search coils was sampled by electronic- microcontroller board .
In other words , electronic-microcontroller board has been designed for measuring simultaneously sampling data of the flux linkage in cross-section of mentioned generator ( see Fig 5 ( b ) ) .
In fact , the 48 search coils are sampled simultaneously in a specific angular position of the rotor ( for example θ = 0 , see Fig 5 ( b ) ) by electronic-microcontroller board .
Serial port interface has been used for connecting electronic-microcontroller board to computer .
The induced voltages from the search coils are communicated to serial port of the computer by means of electronic-microcontroller board .
Fig 6 shows the technique for implementation of the designed fault locator ( also see Fig 4 ) .

Analysis and detection of faulty phase In lap wound machines , electrical space phase shift between the magnetic axis of the faulty coil and the original magnetic axis of phase winding depends on the location of the shorted coil , the number of coils per phase and the distribution of the coils in the stator slots .
Consequently , it is hard to detect the faulty phase in these types of machines ( Ahmed et al. , 2006 ) .
Also , the previous work indicated the difficulty of finding clear fault signatures in a machine equipped with stator winding configurations of the parallel branches in internal faults ( Negrea , 2007 ) .

On the other hand , when the stator winding inter-turn fault occurs , induced voltages in the faulted area search coils changes more than that of the other search coils .
Because voltage difference and circulating current will occur therefore flux linkage in these areas will be most affected with this fault .
This concept is shown in Fig 9 .
Induced voltage in the different search coils after the occurrence of fault on… Fig 9 .
Induced voltage in the different search coils after the occurrence of fault on the coil between 21st and 31st slots .
To demonstrate this concept , we have created an experimental turn–to-turn fault on the coil between 21st and 31st slots , and induced voltage in 48 search coils have measured .
For instance , induced voltage waveforms in four search coils on different area have shown in Fig 9 .
According to this figure , induced voltage in 31st search coil has more change to induced voltage in other search coils that indicates , fault has occurred in relative phase of slot 31 .
The detailed data of the two experiment tests of the shorted turns in phase V and W are listed in Table 1 .
The experiment data obtained over the complete cross-section of the mentioned generator .
These data are sampled simultaneously from the 48 search coils by electronic-microcontroller board in specific angular position of the rotor that is given in Fig 5 ( b ) ( θ = 0 ) .

Sampled voltages due to the experiment tests of the shorted turns in phase V and phase W ( volt ) .
It must be noted , by regarding to nature of the used search coil and the number of machine slots ( 48 slots ) these inputs can be expanded to 96 data in order to enhance the accuracy .
In Table 1 , No .

The absolute magnitude of the difference between the normal ( S.N ) and fault ( S.F ) values are presented by DIF .
On the other hand , winding arrangement and geometry of the machine under study in this work are shown in Fig 10 .

Fig 11 ( a ) shows the experiment result of the shorted turns in two branches on the coils between 4th and 14th slots and 5th and 15th slots in phase V at 50 % ( tap to terminal ) of branch1 and 75 % ( tap to terminal ) of branch2 ( corresponding detailed data are presented in Table 1 ) .
In this figure , the difference between the normal and fault values are presented .
According to this figure , the amplitude of the difference between the normal and fault values in phase V are larger than the other phases that indicate fault has occurred in phase V. Difference induced voltage between the normal condition and faulty condition of… Fig 11 .

Fig 11 ( b ) shows the experiment result of the shorted turns in two branches on the coils between 24th and 34th slots and 25th and 35th slots in the phase U at 5 % ( tap to terminal ) of branch1 and 45 % ( tap to terminal ) of branch2 .
In this figure , the difference between the normal and fault values are presented .
According to this figure , the amplitude of the difference between the normal and fault values in phase U are larger than the other phases that indicate fault has occurred in phase U .
In these two cases , the magnetic axes of the faulty coils approximately are placed under q-axis ( in θ = 0 , see Fig 10 ) so the flux linkages between the faulty coils and the other windings will be large due to the minimum reluctance between the stator and rotor in these areas .
Hence , flux linkage variations to normal condition will be large in the faulty phase .
Fig 12 ( a ) illustrates the experiment result in case of turn-to-turn short circuit in the same branch on the coil between 21st and 31st slots in phase W ( in θ = 0 ) .
The corresponding detailed data of this case ( case1 ) are listed in Table 1 .
Approximately 35 % of the total turn number of the stator winding are short circuited .
Difference induced voltage between the normal condition and faulty condition of… Fig 12 .

( a ) Magnetic axis of the faulty coil is placed under d-axis .
( b ) Magnetic axis of the faulty coil is placed under q-axis .
This figure shows that amplitude of the difference between the normal and fault values in the area between the two slots 21 and 31 have significant change .
In this case , the magnetic axis of the faulty coil is placed under d-axis .
Also , Fig 12 ( b ) again shows the experiment result in case of turn-to-turn short circuit in the same branch on the coil between 21st and 31st slots in phase W. But in this case , the position of rotor is changed that the magnetic axis of the faulty coil is placed under q-axis .
This figure shows that the amplitude of the difference between the normal and fault values in phase W are larger than the other phases .
The behavior of these two faults in phase W can be explained as follows : when the magnetic axis of the faulty coil is placed under d-axis ( see Fig 10 ) , flux linkage between the faulty coil and the other windings will be small due to the large air gap between the stator and rotor in these areas .
Therefore , induced voltage in search coils in these areas will have less variation to normal condition .
In fact , when an inter-turn short circuit occurs , flux linkage variation will be large in search coils placed under poles in the area between the two faulty slots ( see Figs .
10 and 12 ( a ) ) .
In case of the magnetic axis of the faulty coil is placed under q-axis , the flux linkages between the faulty coil and the other windings will be large due to the minimum reluctance between the stator and rotor in these areas .
Hence , flux linkage variation to normal condition will be large in the faulty phase .
On the other hand , for suitable analysis , software with a graphical user interface has been designed in MATLAB ( see Fig 13 ( a ) ) .
For example , Fig 14 ( b ) shows the 48 air gap flux waveform under normal condition , which are induced in the search coils .
In this figure , symmetry in the magnetic field distribution under healthy conditions is presented .

In this figure , loss of symmetry in the magnetic field distribution during inter-turn fault is presented .
Fig 14 shows the experiment result in case of turn-to-turn short circuit on the coil between 21st and 31st slots in phase W. This figure shows that the symmetry in the magnetic field distribution in phase W is lost ( see figures correspond to the search coils 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 30 , 31 , 32 , and 33 ) that indicate fault has occurred in phase W .
When a synchronous generator is working under healthy condition , it is clear that the flux distribution should be symmetrical , neglecting the insignificant inherent asymmetry due to the differences on mechanical structures .
But this inherent asymmetry in the machine used in this study is higher duo to fatigue and lack of optimal design .
By regarding to number of poles in the mentioned generator , its cross-section is divided into four areas .
For instance , by using data from Table 1 , absolute values of samples in each area are added with together .
These results are presented in Table 2 .
As is seen from Table 2 , in the normal condition the difference between these data is 8 % and in the second case the difference between the data is 2.89 % .
But , when an inter-turn short circuit occurs , this flux asymmetry will be higher than the normal value .
In the fault conditions the maximum difference between these data is 16 % and 12.3 % .

Number of search coils Turn-to-turn short circuit at two branches in phase V Excitation current = 2.1 A Turn-to-turn short circuit at the same branch in phase W – case 1 Excitation current = 3 A Normal Fault Normal Fault 2–13 6.69 7.76 8.29 7.96 14–25 6.8 8.36 8.29 6.99 26–37 6.47 8 8.21 7.25 38–1 6.24 7.07 8.05 7.97 Maximum difference 8 % 16 % 2.89 % 12.3 % Therefore , according to delaminating clustering , the input data is classified step by step .
Hence , based on the previous discussion , the fault class is divided into normal and fault .
This process is illustrated in Fig 15 .
Delaminating diagram of fault diagnosis Fig 15 .
Delaminating diagram of fault diagnosis .
By examination of different conditions , threshold value to separate normal and fault is set at 10 % .
So we can classify the input data into normal or fault based on threshold value .
Then , we classify the fault data in order to detect the faulty phase .
It must be noted , that the best threshold value for each machine can be obtained by analysis of sampling data from normal performance of the machine in a specified period of time .
On the other hand , based on the previous discussion and the experimental results in Section 2 , amplitude of the difference voltage between the normal and fault conditions and its angle information in cross-section of the machine have effective role for detection of faulty phase .
Hence in order to detect the faulty phase , probabilistic neural network is used to design the fault diagnosis system .
In fact , the basic probabilistic neural network is integrated with discrete wavelet transform ( DWT ) to construct the MWPNN as classifier .
Magnetic flux linkage data of the stator teeth in different angle ( θ1 , θ2 , … , θ48 ) with 48 components are used as input for training and testing the MWPNN ( see Fig 5 ( b ) ) .
The MWPNN is trained by features extracted from the magnetic flux linkage data through the discrete wavelet transform .
In this investigation , discrete approximation of Meyer wavelet is used as the mother wavelet and approximation signal at level 4 is fed to MWPNN .
MWPNN is trained with simulation data ( software section ) and then MWPNN is tested with experimental data ( hardware section ) .
In fact , similar to training section the measured slot flux linkage is preprocessed with wavelet transform and then in order to detect the faulty phase , approximation signal at level 4 is fed to MWPNN .
The training database for the MWPNN is generated by 3D-FEM .
Since the FEM simulation is a time-consuming process , hence in order to reduce the number of FEM computations generalized regression neural network was used to estimate the flux linkages characteristics of synchronous generator under various conditions .
Algorithm of proposed method is shown in Fig 16 .

Generalized regression neural network GRNN is a kind of radial basis network that is often used for function approximation .
Hence this neural network is used to build training database for the MWPNN .
In fact , instead of the traditional look-up table and interpolation methods , a GRNN is used and trained for estimating the nonlinear flux linkage .
It must be noted that , the FEM computation needs to be performed only several key states in different coil positions .
Then , these data ( obtained from FEM computation ) will be used as inputs for training the GRNN .
After the GRNN is trained , it will be used to estimate the nonlinear flux linkage of the machine in other conditions .
Therefore the aim of GRNN network is to estimate the flux linkage in cross-section of machine for a given set of input under healthy and faulty conditions .
Model validation After the GRNN is trained , the next step is to ensure its performance , that is , how it behaves to an arbitrary input which is not in the training set .
In order to check this performance , diverse set of inputs are selected .
These test load points ( computed by FEM ) are presented as inputs for training the GRNN .
Then the GRNN estimates the nonlinear flux linkage in cross-section of the machine .
For instance in two excitation current ( 2.1 A , 2.4 A ) , nonlinear flux linkage of the machine were estimated .
In order to check the accuracy and validity of the GRNN-based flux linkages , the flux linkages at these test points were recomputed using the FEM technique and are shown in Fig 17 .
As observed , there is an excellent agreement between GRNN-based and FEM computed flux linkages .

The detail data , computed using the FEM technique and estimated by GRNN are presented in Table 3 .
Columns 4 and 7 of Table 3 show the percentage error between the GRNN based and FEM computed flux linkages .
As shown in Table 3 , the maximum error between the predicted ( GRNN-based ) and FEM computed flux linkage is less than 5 % .

Building training database for the MWPNN From the previous results , we can conclude : if the parameters of the FEM-based model are available for some fault cases , the parameters for other fault cases can be easily estimated by GRNN .
In other words , the FEM computation needs to be performed only several key states in different coil positions and other states will be estimated with GRNN .
This demonstrates the practicality of building the FEM-based model for various internal fault conditions .
In order to build flux linkage look-up table , the variation range of excitation current and short circuit turn ratio needs to be determined first .
In our work power factor is one duo to a three-phase resistive load and regarding to the nameplate of machine the variation range of excitation current is set as 2–7 A and short circuit turn ratio is set from 5 % to 65 % .
For instance in this work , in case of turn-to-turn short circuit in the same branch , we use 1 A and 10 % as the computational steps for excitation current and short circuit turn ratio .
In the input training data for each coil ( 8 coils ) , the short circuit turn ratio ( α ) varies as follows : 5 % , 15 % , 25 % , 35 % , 45 % , 55 % , and 65 % .
Corresponding to each short circuit turn ratio , the excitation current , load current , and fault current have different values .
Computational steps for the excitation current are considered as follows : 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 A .
For each excitation current , load current , and fault current are calculated in corresponding short circuit turn ratio with the equations described in Section 2 .
So totally , 336 cases that 196 = 8 ( coil ) × 4 ( α ) × 6 ( excitation current ) cases computed by 3D-FEM and 8 × 3 × 6 = 144 cases estimated by GRNN are considered to build the flux table for each phase .
Therefore , 336 × 3 ( number of phases ) = 1008 sets of input-output are used to train the MWPNN to detect the faulty phase ( each 336 cases representing one phase ) .
The input data used in this method are the steady state data .
It must be noted , that by regarding to practical load point , the variation range of variables can be limited .
Hence , computations will be reduced .
Also , the small computational steps will improve the accuracy of the detection .
MWPNN is used as supervised classifier .
In design of the MWPNN , it is very important to select an optimal value of the smoothing parameter .
Procedure of classifying starts with finding the optimal smoothing value for MWPNN .
The traditional trial and error method is used to obtain optimum smoothing factor .
The second step of the classifying process is to find a good training set .
Cure must be taken in choosing data for obtaining a good training set in order to increase the performance of a neural network .
The smoothing parameter is given by ( 5 ) ( Tripathy et al. , 2007 ) .
( 5 ) where denotes the distance between the jth sample and nearest neighbor sample in class i and g is a constant value that has been found experimentally .

Evaluation of performance To evaluate the performance of MWPNN , its results are compared with different artificial neural networks .
These different networks are trained and subsequently tested with same data due to similar procedure that has been mentioned before .
These data for training are obtained from computation with FEM and estimated by GRNN .
Then ANNs are tested with experimental data .
These simultaneously data over the complete cross-section of machine are sampled with designed electronic-microcontroller board .
First fault diagnosis system uses BP neural network .
Second system uses PNN and third system uses MWPNN .
It must be noted that backpropagation neural network is most widespread among all artificial neural networks .
These networks are also make reference to as multilayered perceptron ( MLP ) or feedforward networks .
The multilayered perceptron neural network is trained with the Batch Gradient Descent with Momentum .
For the MLP neural network , several network configurations were tried , and better results have been obtained by a network constituted by three layers with 48 , 24 , and 3 neurons .
Also , sigmoid is selected as the act function of neurons in every layer .
The results of comparison are presented in Table 5 .

This paper describes an artificial neural networks-based approach for locating internal faults in salient-pole synchronous generator .
This method uses samples of magnetic flux linkages to reach a decision .
The design procedure and various design issues have been discussed .
The designed AI-based locator takes into account all the practical limitations associated with a real system and the hardware .
MWPNN is found to be a more efficient classification model compared to the other neural networks .
In this research , the faulty phase for inter-turn short circuit faults is diagnosed .
It must be noted that , in internal faults it is hard to detect the faulty phase and finding clear fault signatures in a machine equipped with stator winding consisting of lap winding and parallel branches .
Therefore this method may be more effective for detecting the faulty coils under inter-turn short circuit faults in a generator equipped with a stator winding consisting of series connection .
