The current energy consumption in most of the countries is weighing heavily on fossil fuels , which account for about 70–90 % of total energy used .
The ecological concerns about air pollution and global warming are encouraging wider use of clean renewable technologies such as wind and solar energy .
In this paper , Gbest guided artificial bee colony algorithm ( GABC ) is applied to optimize the emission and overall cost of operation of wind–thermal power system .
The random nature of wind power is modeled using weibull probability distribution function ( PDF ) .
Moreover , the uncertainty in wind power is considered in the cost model by including the power imbalance terms such as overestimation and underestimation costs of available wind power .
To validate the effectiveness of proposed method , it is first applied to three standard test systems considering different technical constraints such as valve loading effect , prohibited zones , ramp rate limits , etc .
In second part , the effect of wind power generation on dispatch cost and emission is analyzed for IEEE-30 bus test system .
A comparative analysis with other similar optimization techniques reveals that the proposed technique has better solution accuracy and convergence results .
The majority of the world ’ s power plants produce electricity with natural gas , coal or oil as primary resource to drive electrical generators .
The human induced greenhouse gas emissions particularly carbon dioxide is the main cause of global warming .
The carbon tax is one of available measures for the policy makers to promote the effective technology that can help to reduce the discharge of greenhouse gases .
Several countries have begun to implement carbon tax to reduce green gas emission in response to the commitment under United Nations framework convention on climate change ( UNFCCC ) ( Lu , Tong , & Liu , 2010 ) .
The increasing environmental awareness requires that the system operator should supply electricity to consumers at lowest possible cost and with minimum emissions .
There are several approaches to reduce emissions in power plants , such as use of alternative fuels with a low emission potential , change in the active power dispatch strategies , adoption of energy-efficient technologies in place of the existing technologies .
Another approach is use of renewable energy resources such as wind and solar .
With availability of economic incentives and other policy mechanisms , there is a growing trend for wind energy installations all around the world .
However , the uncertain nature of wind power can be a challenge to the electrical system , which has evolved to respond to variations in the demand for electricity by dispatching power from conventional power plants .
In previous studies , wind power is taken into account by assuming perfect forecast accuracy to determine best possible active power schedule for a given load ( Denny & O ’ Malley , 2006 ; Lee , 2008 ; Lee , Lin , Liao , & Tsao , 2011 ; Liao , 2011 ; Ummels , Gibescu , Pelgrum , Kling , & Brand , 2007 ) .
A specific reserve requirement has been considered in these studies to prevent unstable system operation , if the wind power is different from the forecast .
On the other hand some studies presents solutions to scheduling problem using fuzzy model ( Miranda & Hang , 2005 ) or using correlated wind speed data ( Wang & Singh , 2008 ) for wind speed prediction .
In recent studies , the Weibull PDF is considered to be the best fitting model for the empirical wind speed distribution ( Azizipanah , Niknam , Roosta , Malekpour , & Zare , 2012 ; Guo et al. , 2012 ; Hetzer , Yu , & Bhattrarai , 2008 ; Liu & Xu , 2010 ; Shi , Wang , Yao , Ni , & Bazargan , 2012 ; Yao et al. , 2012 ; Mondal , Bhattacharya , & Halder nee Dey , 2013 ) .
Traditionally , the economic dispatch ( ED ) is most widely adopted tool in power system operation and planning .
The aim of classical ED is to allocate the active power output of generating units to minimize the total operating cost while fulfilling equality and inequality constraints .
On the other hand , the economic emission dispatch ( EED ) problem is a nonlinear bi-objective optimization problem designed to deal with minimization of two conflicting objectives namely fuel cost and air pollution from thermal power plants simultaneously .
The consideration of practical constraints such as ramp rate limits , valve point loading effect , prohibited operating zones ( POZs ) and environmental emissions lead to a non-linear and non-convex optimization problem with plenty of local optima .
Unfortunately , for generating units with nonlinear and non-convex characteristics , the conventional methods such as Lambda-Iteration and gradient methods can barely reach the best possible or near best possible solution .
Although these techniques have been extensively tried in many applications , they reveal number of limitations mainly due to nonlinear nature of objective function because of valve loading effects and presence of POZs .
Moreover , for a large-scale system , the classical methods have oscillatory problems as they are sensitive to initial estimates , resulting in less accuracy or a sub-optimal solution and computational challenges .
In particular the generation scheduling problem solutions considering non-smooth cost function and different practical constraints addressed in recent studies specifically focuses on new and hybrid algorithms such as Fuzzy adaptive chaotic ant swarm optimization , ( FCASO ) ( Cai , Li , Li , Peng , & Yang , 2012a , b ) , Modified group search optimizer method ( MGSO ) ( Zare , Haque , & Davoodi , 2012 ) , Differential harmony search ( DHS ) ( Wang & Li , 2013 ) , θ-particle swarm optimization ( θ-PSO ) ( Hosseinnezhad & Ebrahim , 2013 ) , Improved particle swarm optimization ( CCPSO ) ( Park , Jeong , Shin , & Lee , 2010 ) ) , Modified PSO ( MPSO ) ( Mehdi , Malihe , & Hossein , 2010 ) , Dynamic search space squeezing improved particle swarm optimization ( DPSO ) ( Barisal , 2013 ) , Shuffled differential evolution ( SDE ) ( Reddy & Vaisakh , 2013 ) , firefly algorithm ( FF ) ( Yang , Hosseinib , & Gandomic , 2012 ) , Hybrid chaotic particle swarm – sequential quadratic programming optimization ( CPSO–SQP ) ( Cai , Li , Li , Peng , & Yang , 2012a , b ) , New honey bee mating optimization ( NHBM ) ( Niknam , Mojarrad , Meymand , & Firouzi , 2011 ) , Fuzzy adaptive particle swarm optimization-Nelder–Mead ( FAPSO-NM ) ( Niknam , 2010 ) , Variable differential evolution with the fuzzy adaptive PSO ( FAPSO–VDE ) ( Niknam , Mojarrad , & Meymand , 2011a , b ) , Iteration particle swarm optimization ( ItrPSO ) ( Safari & Shayeghi , 2011 ) , Effortless hybrid method ( EHM ) ( Pourakbari & Rashidi , 2011 ) , Seeker optimization algorithm ( SOA ) , ( Shaw , Mukherjee , & Ghoshal , 2012 ) , Hybrid quantum mechanics inspired particle swarm optimization ( QPSO ) ( Chakraborty , Senjyu , Yona , Saber , & Funabashi , 2011 ) , Hybrid swarm intelligence based harmony search ( HHS ) ( Pandi , Panigrahi , Bansal , Das , & Mohapatra , 2011 ) , Direct search and signal-to-noise ratio ( NDS ) ( Lin , Gowa , & Tsai , 2011 ) , Hybrid multi-agent based particle swarm optimization ( HMAPSO ) ( Kumar , Sharma , & Sadu , 2011 ) , Multiple Tabu search ( MTS ) ( Sa-ngiamvibool , Pothiya , & Ngamroo , 2011 ) , Enhanced Self-adaptive real-coded genetic algorithm using Taguchi method ( TSARGA ) ( Subbaraj , Rengaraj , & Salivahanan , 2011 ) , Fuzzy adaptive modified particle swarm optimization ( FAMPSO ) ( Niknam , Mojarrad , & Nayeripour , 2010 ) , Continuous quick group search optimizer ( CQGSO ) ( Moradi-Dalvand , Mohammadi-Ivatloo , Najafi , & Rabiee , 2012 ) , Hybrid genetic-algorithm ( GA-API ) ( Ciornei & Kyriakides , 2012 ) , Biogeography-based optimization ( BBO ) , ( Bhattacharya & Chattopadhyay , 2010 ) , Iteration PSO with time varying acceleration coefficients ( IPSO-TVAC ) ( Mohammadi , Rabiee , Soroudi , & Ehsan , 2012 ) , New PSO with local random search ( NPSO-LRS ) ( Selvakumar & Thanushkodi , 2007 ) , Anti-predatory PSO ( APSO ) ( Selvakumar & Thanushkodi , 2008 ) etc .
Artificial bee colony ( ABC ) algorithm ( Karaboga & Basturk , 2008 ) invented recently in 2005 is one of the swarm intelligence algorithms that mimics the foraging behavior of honey bees and has shown great potential and good performance to solve problems for optimizing nonlinear and non-differentiable continuous space functions .
Due to its simple structure and quick convergence ability , ABC algorithm has been implemented in numerous engineering and non engineering applications .
Moreover , an ABC has been successfully applied to different fields of power system including economic dispatch ( Basu , 2013 ; Hemamalini & Simon , 2010 ) and optimal power flow ( Khorsandi , Hosseinian , & Ghazanfari , 2013 ) .
The other applications includes fault section estimation ( Huang & Liu , 2013 ) , optimal reactive power flow ( Ayan & Kılıç , 2012 ) , automatic generation control ( Haluk , Cengiz , & İlhan , 2012 ) , automatic voltage regulation ( Haluk & Cengiz , 2011 ) etc .
To make ABC more effective , in certain applications , the basic ABC is combined with other evolutionary optimization algorithms to form hybrid ABC algorithm .
In particular , Liao , Jianzhong , Rui , and Yongchuan ( 2012 ) proposes an adaptive artificial bee colony algorithm for long-term economic dispatch in cascaded hydropower systems , Chandrasekaran , Hemamalini , Sishaj , Simon , and Narayana ( 2012 ) presents binary/real coded artificial bee colony algorithm for thermal unit commitment problem , Li , Wang , and Bin ( 2013 ) proposes a hybrid artificial bee colony assisted differential evolution algorithm for optimal reactive power flow problem while incremental artificial bee colony with local search ( IABC ) is another variant of ABC reported recently by Ozyon and Aydin ( 2013 ) for economic dispatch studies .
In spite of these improvements , ABC may sometimes fail to progress in the direction of the global optimal for multimodal nonlinear functions .
An improved version of ABC algorithm incorporating the information of global best solution into the solution search equation of basic ABC algorithm is reported in this paper .
It is applied to wind thermal economic emission dispatch ( WTEED ) problem considering wind power as stochastic variable .
The proposed ABC algorithm is basically based on Gbest guided artificial bee colony algorithm ( GABC ) ( Zhu & Kwong , 2010 ) which is hybrid of basic ABC and most popular particle swarm optimization algorithm .
The main contributions of this work are as follows : The proposed methodology is applied to three benchmark economic dispatch problems considering all practical constraints .
GABC algorithm is implemented on a modified IEEE-30 bus test system consisting of six thermal units and two wind farms to solve WTEED problem .
The best results obtained from the solution of the ED problem by GABC algorithm are compared with those published in the recent state-of-the art literatures .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows .
Section 2 gives the mathematical formulation of the ED problem and wind speed characterization ; Section 3 provides solution procedure to implement GABC for WTEED problem ; Section 4 presents simulation results and discussion on solution quality .
Conclusions are summarized in Section 5 .
This section deals with mathematical formulation of WTEED problem considering the stochastic availability of wind power and emission restrictions ( carbon tax ) .
The model aims at minimizing carbon tax and overall cost of operational which includes fuel cost of thermal units and other costs associated with wind power .
Characterization stochastic nature of wind As shown in ( Mukund & Patel , 2005 ) , the characteristic of wind speed variations can be described by weibull probability distribution function , with shape factor and scale factor .
During any given time interval , the probability of wind speeds being can be written as in ( 1 ) , ( 1 ) The terms is the fraction of time for which the wind speed is , m/s .
The cumulative distribution function , is the probability that the wind speed is same or less than m/s given by ( 2 ) , ( 2 ) The cumulative distribution function is the integral of weibull PDF .
The output of the wind turbine generator for a given wind speed input is given below by ( 3 ) – ( 5 ) : ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( 5 ) where is the air density in kg/m3 , is swept area of wind turbine blade in , vi is cut-in speed , is cut out speed and is rated speed of wind turbine system .
The probability of the wind power being zero , rated and in between zero and rated is given respectively by ( 6 ) – ( 8 ) ( Yao et al. , 2012 ) , ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) 2.2 .
Probabilistic bi-objective economic emission dispatch formulation The overall cost of operation of conventional and wind powered generators is given by ( 9 ) ( Yao et al. , 2012 ) , ( 9 ) The leading term in ( 9 ) represents cost function of thermal generator and includes valve loading effects modeled in terms of sinusoidal function .
The second term stands for direct cost of wind power purchased from wind farm operator which is assumed to be owned by non-utility operator .
Though the wind energy conversion systems have low variable costs , the operation and maintenance cost is substantial .
The third term corresponds to penalty cost which is due to underestimation of available wind power that results in wind spillage and hence loss of low-priced available wind power .
Similarly the fourth term represents reserve cost which is due to overestimation of available wind power .
This term becomes significant when a large wind power is comparable part of overall power capacity of system in which the system incur additional costs to provide reliable backup for the wind turbines ( Alhasawi & Milanovic , 2012 ) .
The last term corresponds to carbon emission cost which is due to emission produced by thermal generators .
The term is called carbon tax price ( $ /ton ) and its value depends on policy makers of country .
System constraints The probabilistic optimization formulation in ( 9 ) is subject to the following set of equality and inequality constraints .
Power balance The equality constraint in ( 10 ) gives the power balance between generation and load , including the transmission losses ( PLoss ) .
The constraints in ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) limit the power output of thermal units and wind energy conversion system within their lower and upper limits .
( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 ) where the transmission loss , is approximated in terms of matrices as a function of the real output power of thermal units in the following form , ( 13 ) 2.3.2 .
Prohibited operating zone of thermal generators The fuel cost curves of practical steam turbine driven generators are discontinuous as whole of the unit operating range is not always available for preparing dispatch schedule due to some faults in the machines or their accessories such as pumps , boilers etc. , or vibrations in shaft bearing .
It means that the thermal units have POZs ( Orero & Irving , 1996 ) which results in discontinuity in cost curve and hence it requires special attention to find feasible solution .
In practice , the system operator is not allowed to work in these regions .
The feasible operating zones of thermal units can be represented as ( 14 ) where represents the number of POZs of thermal unit , and are respectively the lower and upper limits of prohibited zone of thermal unit .
Ramp rate limits of thermal generators In actual practice the system operator prepares optimum schedules every hour or half an hour for a given load .
As the load on system changes in subsequent planning intervals the power output of thermal units is changed to adjust units output to match the load .
This change does not take place instantaneously whenever load changes .
When the generator ramp-rate limits are considered , the operating limits of the generating unit are modified as follows ( Chaturvedi , Pandit , & Srivastava , 2008 ) , ( 15 ) where is the previous operating point of the thermal unit and and are the down and up ramp rate limits , respectively .
Cost function for wind farm Usually the wind farms are owned by private parties and the grid operators pay for wind power purchased from wind farm operators based on the power purchase agreement .
A linear cost function for power derived from the wind-farm operator is given below ( Hetzer et al. , 2008 ) , ( 16 ) where is the direct cost coefficient for wind farm .
The analysis in literature shows that the total costs of wind generation is around 57 % of the total thermal costs ( Juliana & Sauer , 2013 ) .
So this cost coefficient can be chosen accordingly in optimal dispatch formulation .
Cost due to underestimation of available wind power An excess of wind generation due to underestimation of wind power may cause system operating problems such as transmission line congestion that leads to wind generator power curtailment during normal operation .
Wind farm operators are rewarded depending upon electricity market structure .
This amount is generally 15–100 % of the amount that the wind farm operator could have earned otherwise ( Ackermann et al. , 2009 ) .
The penalty cost for not using available wind power for wind farm is formulated below as : ( 17 ) where is penalty cost coefficient due to underestimation of wind power for wind farm in $ /h , is generated or available wind power of wind farm in MW and is a probability density function of wind power output .
Cost due to overestimation of wind power The reserve cost as a result of overestimation of available wind power from wind farm is formulated as : ( 18 ) where is reserve cost coefficient due to overestimation of wind power for wind farm in $ /h .
Analysis of overestimation and underestimation costs The analysis of overestimation cost is carried out by assuming wind farm of equivalent rated power .
Let the forecasted wind power of a wind farm is assumed to be ( ) and power actually produced is .
The overestimation cost is given by ( 19 ) , ( 19 ) ( 20 ) ( 21 ) The underestimation cost is analyzed in a similar manner and is given by Eq ( 22 ) ( 22 ) where ( 23 ) ( 24 )
Artificial bee colony algorithm The colony of artificial bees consists of three types of bees namely employed bees ( ) , onlooker bees ( ) and scout bees .
All bees that are currently exploiting a food source ( probable candidate solution ) are called employed bees while the bees waiting in the hive are called onlooker bees .
The scout bees search for new food sources in a random way .
The employed bees transport loads of nectar from the food source to the hive and also share the information about the position of food source with onlooker bees by performing specific type of dance .
All onlookers watch the numerous dances performed by employed bees and based on the information received from employed bees the onlookers choose a best food source .
A particular food source is selected by onlooker bee depending on its probability ( ) value using ( 25 ) , ( 25 ) where is the fitness value of the candidate solution ( food source ) and .
The term indicates number of decision variables .
Equation ( 25 ) suggests that the good food sources attract more onlooker bees compared to bad ones .
This means more onlookers are deputed to place where the probability of getting good quality food source is more .
The onlookers or scout bees are visualized as employed bee once they find a food source and starts exploiting it .
An employed bee becomes scout bees , once the food source associated with it , gets completely exhausted .
The scout searches for new food source randomly according to ( 26 ) .
( 26 ) where represents upper and lower limits of decision variable of solution and the term represents random number between 0 and 1 .
The complete solution vector for food source in the population can be represented by .
In ABC algorithm , the entire population represents a set of possible solutions , which also represents position of food source .
The search process in ABC algorithm is carried out in four steps viz .
initialization , employed bee phase , onlooker bee phase and scout bee phase .
In the initialization process , a set of candidate solutions are randomly generated using ( 26 ) .
Each employed and onlooker bee is assigned a task of searching a new food source by modifying the associated food source using Eq ( 27 ) : ( 27 ) where is a random number in the interval [ −1 , 1 ] , is new candidate solution ( food source ) , is current food source associated with employed bee , is food source in the neighbourhood of and j randomly chosen index such that .
The new food source is compared with i.e. , the nectar amount of new food source is compared with old one to decide the better solution or food source .
The bee remembers new food source if it is better than old one otherwise old food source is retained in the memory i.e .
greedy selection process is applied .
Each food source in the ABC algorithm has a trail counter named as TL .
If the new food source associated with employed and onlooker bees can not be further modified after a certain number of trail limits , the food source is discarded and subsequently the associated bee becomes a scout bee .
The scout bee so generated randomly searches a new food source according to ( 26 ) and becomes an employed bee again .
The trail limit is a control parameter of ABC algorithm and it controls generation of scout bees .
At the end of each search cycle the trail limit value is compared with trail limit counter .
If the value of trail limit counter exceeds the predefined trail limit value , the employed bee of this food source becomes a scout bee .
The entire food search process of artificial bee colony algorithm is shown in Fig 1 .
Flowchart of the ABC algorithm Fig 1 .
Flowchart of the ABC algorithm .
Gbest guided artificial bee colony algorithm ( GBAC ) The basic ABC algorithm does not use the global best solution of population in each generation to direct the search trajectory towards global optimal solution .
It has been reported in old literature that the ABC algorithm has good global search capability but poor local search capability , while the PSO has good local search ability but poor global search ability .
In order to enhance the exploitation capability of ABC algorithm i.e. , to improve the ability to apply the knowledge of the previous good solutions to find even better candidate solutions , an additional term is introduced in ( 27 ) ( Zhu & Kwong , 2010 ) .
The modified Eq ( 28 ) directs the search path towards global optima .
( 28 ) where C is a random number in the interval between [ 0 , 2 ] and the term , represents element of the global best solution in current generation .
Improved GABC algorithm To further strengthen the exploitation capability of ABC algorithm , Eq ( 25 ) is modified to obtain the following Eq ( 29 ) ( Karaboga , Ozturk , Karaboga , & Gorkemli 2012 ) , ( 29 ) where is the fitness value of global best solution i.e .
the best solution among current solution vector .
Thus the new search process takes advantage of knowledge of the global best solution to modify the search trajectory similar to PSO .
The tuning parameter C should be properly chosen so that the new solution is not driven away from desired candidate solution .
The small value of this control parameter may not improve solution quality as ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) produces nearly same results .
On the other hand , the large value of C may reduce exploration capability of search process .
Solution procedure to implement GABC for WTEELD problem The unknown variables in optimization process are active power outputs of thermal units and wind farm output power in MW .
The optimum value of these unknown variables produces desired power at minimum cost .
The step by step procedure to formulate the WTEELD problem using GABC algorithm is as follows : Step 1 I .
Specify the cost and emission coefficients , valve-point coefficients , prohibited operating zones , ramp rate limits and active power limits for each thermal unit .
II .
Specify parameters of weibull probability distribution function of wind speed , active power limits and cost coefficients of wind turbines .
III .
Specify parameters of the GABC algorithm such as the number of employed bees ( ) , onlookers ( ) , trial counter limit ( TL ) and tuning constant ( C ) .
Step 2 ( Initialization of population with random solutions ) Initial population is generated arbitrarily from the multi-dimensional search space , , where is the size of the population and are candidate solutions .
Each solution vector is subjected to iterative search processes of the employed bees , the onlooker bees and the scout bees .
The index and , respectively represents the number of thermal units and wind farms , .
All decision variables given by vector are distributed uniformly between their upper and lower generation limits .
For wind thermal dispatch study the random values of solution vector are produced using Eqs .
( 30 ) and ( 31 ) .
( 30 ) ( 31 ) For given scheduling horizon , an initial population is generated according to ( 32 ) , ( 32 ) Step 3 ( Fitness evaluation ) The fitness value of each food source position is checked by evaluating objective function value .
Set the cycle count as 1 and repeat the steps given below until the maximum number of cycles are reached ( termination criteria ) .
Step 4 ( Employed bee phase ) In this step , each employed bee produces a new candidate food source in the vicinity of its current position using ( 28 ) .
If a value of decision parameter produced by ( 28 ) – ( 30 ) exceeds its limit , the parameter is set to its limit value .
The modified food source position is checked for constraints in ( 10 ) – ( 12 ) .
Other constraints such as ramp rate limits and POZs are also checked depending upon test system .
The equality constraints are handled by procedure given in ( Deb , 2000 ) .
Then the fitness value ( objective function value ) of each candidate food source is evaluated .
If the new fitness value is better than the old one , the new food source position is remembered ; otherwise , the old one is retained in the memory .
Step 5 ( Calculating probabilities ) An onlooker chooses a food source position of employed bee depending upon possibility ( probability ) of getting even better food source using ( 29 ) .
Step 6 ( Onlookers phase ) Once the onlooker bee selects the food source position of employed bee , it is further modified to obtain better food source position by using ( 28 ) .
Again greedy selection is applied to retain better solution and discard inferior solution .
Step 7 ( Scout bee phase ) If the a particular solution is not improved for certain trial limits , it is discarded and the scout bee produces a new random solution according to ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) .
Step 8 Remember the best solution ( food source position ) obtained so far .
Increment the iteration count .
Step 9 If the stopping criterion is not fulfilled , go to step 4 .
The stopping criterion in this case is the maximum number of cycles ( MNC ) .
The simulation software for proposed algorithm is implemented using MATLAB 2009b and executed on a 3.2 GHz , Pentium IV processor with 2 GB RAM .
In order to clearly illustrate the global searching ability of the proposed algorithm following cases are considered .
Case A ( Benchmark functions ) – To investigate the capability of proposed optimization algorithm , proposed GABC is experimented on 5 unconstrained benchmark functions .
The best results of GABC algorithm after 50 runs are given in Table 1 .
The results shows in terms of mean value and standard deviation demonstrates the ability of proposed GABC algorithm to escape from local optima and good search capability as most of these benchmark functions are difficult to solve by other optimization algorithms .

Case C ( bi-objective ) – In this case IEEE-30 bus test system suitably modified to accommodate wind power from two wind farms is studied and the optimal results obtained by GABC are compared with other methods .
Parameter selection of GABC algorithm The proper configuration tuning parameter is critical approach .
The proposed approach has three control parameters namely the number of employed bees ( ) , number of onlookers ( ) , and TL value .
In this paper the number of onlooker bees is chosen to be more than the employed bees unlike original ABC .
The values of number of onlooker bees and trial limit are estimated by analyzing the different test cases .
All experiments were run for 500 iterations while estimating optimal settings of GABC parameters .
For illustrative purposes , however , the test system of 15-unit is considered .
Selection of number of onlookers ( 15 unit test system ) After trying different combinations of parameters the best value of number of employed bees for 15 unit test systems is found to be 45 .
The value of trail limit parameter is set 10 .
The number of onlookers is varied from 45 to 450 in step of 45 .
For every step the program was run for 30 trails and mean cost value was recorded .
Fig 2 shows the variation of mean cost for different values of onlooker bees .
It is observed that the algorithm gives least mean cost value when the number of onlooker bees is five times employed bees i.e. , 225 .
Moreover the mean fuel cost obtained by proposed method is 32,753.2693 $ /h when the number of onlookers are equal to number of employed bees .
Also the mean fuel cost value does not change by significant amount when the number of onlooker bees were increased beyond 225 rather the computation time increases .
Therefore , the number of onlookers for 15 unit test system is set to 225 for best results and comparable computational time .
Variation of mean cost for different values of onlookers ( 15 unit system ) Fig 2 .
Variation of mean cost for different values of onlookers ( 15 unit system ) .
Selection of trail limit value In order to see the effect of TL parameter on the mean fuel cost , the number of employed bees is set to 45 and number of onlookers is set to 225 i.e .
five times number of employed bees .
The Fig 3 shows the variation of mean cost for different value of TL varied from 3 to 300 .
When the value of TL is very low i.e .
less than 10 the mean cost obtained by GABC algorithm is on higher side .
Moreover , for higher value of limit parameter the mean cost tends to increase .
For this test system , therefore , the optimal results for mean cost were obtained for value of TL parameter in the neighbourhood of 10 .
Variation of mean cost for different values of Trial Limit parameter ( 15 unit… Fig 3 .
Variation of mean cost for different values of Trial Limit parameter ( 15 unit test system ) .
Selection of parameter C In order to direct the search trajectory towards feasible reason , suitable value of parameter C has to be selected .
The variation of parameter C with respect to mean fuel cost for 15 unit test system is given in Fig 4 .
It can be seen that the mean fuel cost for 15 unit system is minimum for C parameter value of 1.4 .
Table 2 gives the variation of parameter C with respect to mean fuel cost for all three test systems .

Case – A ( Single objective economic dispatch ) 4.2.1 .
Test system 1 ( with prohibited operating zones , ramp rate limits , and transmission network loss ) This test case consists of six thermal units and total load demand is set to 1263 MW .
The system data for this test system is available in ( Niknam , Mojarrad , & Meymand , 2011a , b ; Gaing , 2003 ; Ozyon & Aydin , 2013 ) .
The number of employed bees , onlooker bees and value of TL parameter for this test system are set to , , respectively .
The optimal dispatch schedule of generators and best fuel cost by the proposed algorithm and other methods is presented in Table 3 in which TG indicates total generation in MW , TL indicates total losses in MW , FC is fuel cost in $ /h .
The optimal cost obtained by GABC technique after 50 trails is 15,443.0812 $ /h which is better than recently reported methods .
The fuel cost reported in HQPSO ( Chakraborty et al. , 2011 ) , EHM ( Pourakbari & Rashidi , 2011 ) , CQGSO ( Moradi-Dalvand , Mohammadi-Ivatloo , Najafi , & Rabiee , 2013 ) , and IABC ( Ozyon & Aydin , 2013 ) , is respectively 15,442.98 $ /h ( 12.4078 MW ) , 15,441.5974 $ /h ( 12.4834 MW ) , 15,442.6608 $ /h ( 12.416271 MW ) and 15,441.108 $ /h ( 12.1795 MW ) is better than that of obtained by proposed method .
The quantity in bracket indicates the loss reported in corresponding paper .
However the loss calculated using B matrix of ( Gaing , 2003 ) is respectively 12.4395 MW , 12.7540 MW , 12.4473 MW and 12.3689 MW .
This means the lower fuel cost claimed in these papers is at the cost of constraint violations .

Test system 2 ( with ramp rate limits and prohibited operating zones ) This system has 15 thermal units supplying a system load demand of 2630 MW .
This test system of thermal units has non-convex and non-linear cost function with constraints such as POZs and ramp rate limits .
The best result for fuel cost reported in literatures has wide range of different between the values from 32,542.732 $ /h ( Ozyon & Aydin , 2013 ) , to 32,706.6580 $ /h ( Barisal , 2013 ) .
This is due to different value of elements of B-matrix .
In this paper the value of in B-matrix is set to 0.5 ( Barisal , 2013 ; Subbaraj , Rengaraj , Salivahanan , & Senthilkumar , 2010 ) .
The system data is available in ( Gaing , 2003 ) .
Among the different dispatching units , units 2 , 5 and 6 have three prohibited zones , and unit 12 has two prohibited zones .
The optimal generation cost obtained by GABC is better than all other methods particularly recently reported IPSO ( Barisal , 2013 ) .
Table 5 shows the best dispatch schedule of thermal units for the different methods including proposed one .
The global minimum obtained after 50 trial runs by GABC is 32,706.6566 $ /h satisfies all constraints , such as generation limits , power balance , ramp rate limits and POZs .
The minimum fuel cost reported in MDE ( Amjady & Sharifzadeh , 2010 ) , FF ( Yang et al. , 2012 ) , and HHS ( Fesenghary & Ardehali , 2009 ) is respectively 32,704.9000 $ /h ( 30.62 MW ) , 32,704.4500 $ /h ( 30.6614 MW ) and 32,692.8361 $ /h ( 29.66314 MW ) .
The figures in bracket represent the transmission loss reported in corresponding paper .
The actual transmission loss is recalculated by using the optimal generation schedule given by ( Amjady & Sharifzadeh , 2010 ; Fesenghary & Ardehali , 2009 ; Yang et al. , 2012 ) , using the input data of ( Gaing , 2003 ) , and are found to be respectively 30.8003 MW , 30.8449 MW and 30.8394 MW .
These methods fail to satisfy the power balance equation i.e .
the load demand 2630 MW is not fulfilled .
The convergence characteristic for fifteen-unit test system for proposed algorithm is given in Fig 6 .
Table 6 gives results for minimum , maximum and average fuel cost obtained by GABC and other methods such as asynchronous parallel PSO PAPSO ( Niknam et al. , 2011 ) , parallelized PSO with modified stochastic acceleration factors PSO-MSAF ( Niknam et al. , 2011 ) , bacteria foraging ( BF ) ( Panigrahi & Pandi , 2008 ) , and simulated annealing like particle swarm optimization SA-PSO ( Kuo , 2008a , b ) .

Case – B ( Wind–thermal emission economic dispatch ) In this section , economic emission dispatch problem is solved for considering IEEE-30 bus system connected two wind farms is solved .
Further this section compares the performance of proposed method with QPSO algorithm proposed in ( Yao et al. , 2012 ) .
There are total four different scenarios considered to obtain optimal solution of WTEELD problem .
The first case ( Case 1 ) evaluate single objective optimization problem for six unit system without considering emission and wind power .
The second case ( Case 2 ) solves bi-objective optimization problem for six unit system without considering wind power .
The third case ( Case 3 ) solves single objective optimization problem considering six thermal units and two wind farms but without considering emission constraint .
The fourth case ( Case 4 ) evaluates WTEELD problem considering six thermal units and two wind farms .
For the sake of comparison , the value of carbon tax , and emission coefficients of IEEE-30 bus system given in ( Yao et al. , 2012 ) are considered in the analysis to follow .
Case 1 and 2 In both cases GABC is implemented on IEEE 30 bus test system consists of six thermal units with valve point effects .
The best optimum dispatch schedule for load demand of 1200 MW , 1400 MW and 1600 MW for Case 1 and Case 2 are given in Table 9 .
The minimum fuel costs obtained by proposed algorithm for Case 1 for different load demands of 1200 MW , 1400 MW and 1600 MW are much better than those reported in ( Yao et al. , 2012 ) .
Moreover , the total cost of operation after considering fixed carbon tax at 20 $ /h ( case 2 ) for load of 1200 MW is 48,487 $ /h which is much better than ( Yao et al. , 2012 ) .
The same trend is found for load of 1400 MW and 1600 MW .

Case 3 and 4 In this section WTEELD problem is evaluated by implementing GABC on modified IEEE 30 bus test system ( Yao et al. , 2012 ) considering two wind farms .
The best optimum dispatch schedule for load demand of 1200 MW , 1400 MW and 1600 MW for Case 3 and Case 4 are given in Table 10 .
The imbalance cost given in this Table 10 represents sum of overestimation and underestimation cost in $ /h .
The optimum values of total cost ( TC ) obtained by GABC algorithm are compared with those reported in ( Yao et al. , 2012 ) .
The results obtained by GABC method for 1200 MW , 1400 MW and 1600 MW with and without carbon tax are given in Table 10 .
It is evident that the results for total cost of operation obtained by proposed method are better than ( Yao et al. , 2012 ) .
Moreover , as the direct cost of wind power is assumed to be zero in present work as well as in ( Yao et al. , 2012 ) , the wind power contribution should be close to its rated value .
However , the wind power penetration reported in ( Yao et al. , 2012 ) is very small and therefore the cost of operation is unusually high .
While the wind power penetration obtained by proposed method is close to its rated value due to zero value of wind power cost coefficient .
The convergence characteristics for the best solution for 1600 MW load for case 3 and case 4 are shown in Figs .
8 and 9 .

Results analysis 4.4.1 .
Convergence characteristic and computational efficiency From Fig 5 , it is clear that the proposed method converses to best fuel cost of 15,443.0812 $ /h for six unit system within just 10 iterations .
Similarly , Fig 6 shows that the optimal solution for 15 unit test system by GABC is reached within 50 iterations .
However , for both test systems the additional iterations are performed to ensure the global minimum solution .
Moreover the convergence characteristic for 40 unit test system given in Fig 6 for proposed method takes 60 iterations for tracking best fuel cost value while the ( Reddy & Vaisakh , 2013 ) takes more than 150 iterations to reach to same result .
In all test systems including IEEE 30 bus system the solution trajectory rapidly convergence to optimal value and hence the proposed method has better computation efficiency The average CPU time of proposed method is comparatively less than other methods as shown in Tables 4 , 6 and 8 .
Solution quality and robustness From the result seen in Tables 3–8 , it is obvious that the minimum cost and average obtained by GABC algorithm is least compared to other well established methods .
The standard deviation for all test system is very small compared to other mentioned methods .
Randomness is inherent in all stochastic simulation techniques .
This is due to the fact that the initial population of candidate solutions is created using random numbers .
Hence the performance of stochastic search algorithms is judged by carrying out number of trials .
From Table 11 , It can be seen that the minimum cost obtained by proposed method for 10 independent trails for 15 unit test system is in the range of 32,706.6743–32,706.6566 $ /h .
The frequency of getting fuel cost better than the mean cost value of 32,706.6923 $ /h is high .
Also the frequency of convergence to the optimal fuel cost value for 40 unit test system at different ranges of generation cost and for load demand of 10,500 MW is presented in Table 12 .
It is evident that the frequency of converging to a minimum solution is higher for GABC as compared to the other methods .
This proves that the proposed method is robust and consistence in producing lower cost .

In this paper , an application of Gbest guided artificial bee colony algorithm for ELD problem is developed to get faster and better optimization performance .
Different constraints such as valve point loading effect , ramp rate limits , POZs and environmental emission are taken into consideration to solve the non-convex and non-linear nature of ELD problem .
The method has successfully been applied to three standard test unit systems , consisting of 6 , 15 and 40 thermal units .
The paper also advocates the application of GABC algorithm to six unit test system for WTEELD problem considering effect of wind power .
The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is confirmed by comparing the results with the most recently reported literatures .
The method is easy to apply and the convergence rate is relatively fast .
Also the computational complexities are very less as number of tuning parameters is very less compared to other methods .
From the simulation results it can be concluded that proposed method is a competitive tool to solve the non-smooth nature of generation scheduling problem in power system with nonlinear wind speed model .
