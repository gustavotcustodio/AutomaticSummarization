Case-based reasoning (CBR) is one of the matured paradigms of artificial intelligence for problem solving.
CBR has been applied in many areas in the commercial sector to assist daily operations.
However, CBR is relatively new in the field of forensic science.
Even though forensic personnel have consciously used past experiences in solving new cases, the idea of applying machine intelligence to support decision-making in forensics is still in its infancy and poses a great challenge.
