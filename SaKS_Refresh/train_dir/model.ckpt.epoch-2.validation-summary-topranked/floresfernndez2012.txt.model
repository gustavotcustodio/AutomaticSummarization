Lung cancer is a public health priority worldwide due to the high mortality rate and the costs involved.
Early detection of lung cancer is important for increasing the survival rate, however, frequently its diagnosis is not made opportunely, since detection methods are not sufficiently sensitive and specific.
In recent years serum biomarkers have been proposed as a method that might enhance diagnostic capabilities and complement imaging studies.
However, when used alone they show low sensitivity and specificity because lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease.
