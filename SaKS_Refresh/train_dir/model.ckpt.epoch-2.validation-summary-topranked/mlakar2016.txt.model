Image thresholding is a process for separating interesting objects within an image from their background.
An optimal thresholdâ€™s selection can be regarded as a single objective optimization problem, where obtaining a solution can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially when the number of thresholds increases greatly.
This paper proposes a novel hybrid differential evolution algorithm for selecting the optimal threshold values for a given gray-level input image, using the criterion defined by Otsu.
The hybridization is done by adding a reset strategy, adopted from the Cuckoo Search, within the evolutionary loop of differential evolution.
