Brain tumor grade identification is an invasive technique and clinicians rely on biopsy and spinal tap method.
The proposed method takes an effort to develop a non-invasive method for the tumor grade (Low/High) identification using magnetic resonant images.
The process involves preprocessing, image segmentation, tumor isolation, feature extraction, feature selection and classification.
An analysis on the performance of the segmentation techniques, feature extraction methods, automatic feature selection (SFLA) and constructed classifiers (support vector machines, learning vector quantization and Naives Bayes) is done on the basis of accuracy, efficiency and elapsed time.
