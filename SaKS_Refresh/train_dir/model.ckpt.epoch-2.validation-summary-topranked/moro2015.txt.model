This paper analyzes recent literature in the search for trends in business intelligence applications for the banking industry.
Searches were performed in relevant journals resulting in 219 articles published between 2002 and 2013.
To analyze such a large number of manuscripts, text mining techniques were used in pursuit for relevant terms on both business intelligence and banking domains.
Moreover, the latent Dirichlet allocation modeling was used in order to group articles in several relevant topics.
