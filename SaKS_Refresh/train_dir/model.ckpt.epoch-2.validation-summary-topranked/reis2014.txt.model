In several domains, software applications have intensively used Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) like database schemas, ontologies, taxonomies and thesauri and their associated semantic correspondences (i.e., mappings).
This underlines the relevance and capabilities of KOS and mappings to manage and integrate vast amounts of data.
However, the dynamic nature of domain knowledge forces knowledge engineers to constantly modify KOS, to keep them up to date and useful.
In this context, the maintenance of mappings affected by KOS evolution still remains an open research issue.
