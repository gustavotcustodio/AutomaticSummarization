Rail rolling process is one of the most complicated hot rolling processes.
For this purpose, the data from the Rail and Profile Rolling Mill in Kardemir Iron & Steel Works Co. (Karab√ºk, Turkey) were used.
BD1, BD2, and Tandem are three main parts of the rolling mill, and in order to obtain the force values of the 49 kg/m rail in each pass for the BD1 and BD2 sections, the force and torque values for the Tandem section, parameter values of 60, 54, 46, and 33 kg/m type rails were used.
Comparing the results obtained from the ANN model and the actual field data demonstrated that force and torque values were obtained with acceptable error rates.
