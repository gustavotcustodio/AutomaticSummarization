Permeability prediction has been a challenge to reservoir engineers due to the lack of tools that measure it directly.
Recently, researchers utilized statistical regression, neural networks, and fuzzy logic to estimate both permeability and porosity from well logs.
Unfortunately, due to both uncertainty and imprecision, the developed predictive modelings are less accurate compared to laboratory experimental core data.
This paper presents functional networks as a novel approach to forecast permeability using well logs in a carbonate reservoir.
