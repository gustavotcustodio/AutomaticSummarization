Case-based reasoning (CBR) is one of the matured paradigms of artificial intelligence for problem solving.
Even though forensic personnel have consciously used past experiences in solving new cases, the idea of applying machine intelligence to support decision-making in forensics is still in its infancy and poses a great challenge.
This paper highlights the limitation of the methods used in forensics compared with a CBR method in the analysis of forensic evidences.
Our system is able to extract features by using an information extraction (IE) technique from the existing autopsy reports; then the system analyzes the case similarities by coupling the CBR technique with a Na√Øve Bayes learner for feature-weights learning; and finally it produces an outcome recommendation.
