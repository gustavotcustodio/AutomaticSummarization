The emergence of Omni-channel has affected the practical design of the supply chain network (SCN) with the purpose of providing better products and services for customers.
Sustainable objectives, i.e., reducing economic cost, enlarging customer coverage and weakening environmental influences, are involved in designing the MDCSN.
A modified multi-objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) algorithm is introduced to solve the MDCSCN model, which integrates the priority-based encoding mechanism, the Pareto optimality and the swarm intelligence of the bee colony.
Notations Description The set of suppliers, manufacturers, central DCs, regional DCs and customers The index and capacity of suppliers The index, capacity, fixed cost and environmental influence of manufacturers The index, capacity, fixed cost and environmental influence of central DCs The index, capacity, fixed cost and environmental influence of regional DCs The index and demand of customers The distance between two facilities The unit transportation cost between two facilities The unit environmental influence between two facilities Decision variables Decision variables Description Binary variables denoting the open/close status of manufacturer, central DC and regional DC Binary variables denoting the product flow from supplier to manufacturer, from manufacturer to central DC, from central DC to regional DC and from regional DC to customers Binary variables denoting the product flow from manufacturer and central DC to customers directly Integer variables denoting the amount of product flow from supplier to manufacturer, from manufacturer to central DC, from central DC to regional DC and from regional DC to customers Integer variables denoting the amount of product flow from manufacturer and central DC to customers directly The design of a sustainable SCN consists of three objectives, i.e., the economic objective, the social objective and the environmental objective, which are also known as the triple bottom lines for sustainable development.
