This paper reports the relative performance of an experimental comparison of some well-known classification techniques such as classical statistical, artificial intelligence, mathematical programming (MP), and hybrid approaches.
The data had varying characteristics such as multicollinearity, nonlinearity, sample proportions, etc.
We concentrate on individual error rates for the four groups, i.e., we count the number of group 1 values classified into group 2, group 3, and group 4 and vice versa.
The results indicate that in general not only are MP, k-NN, and hybrid approaches relatively better at overall classification but they also provide a much better balance between error rates for the top customer groups.
