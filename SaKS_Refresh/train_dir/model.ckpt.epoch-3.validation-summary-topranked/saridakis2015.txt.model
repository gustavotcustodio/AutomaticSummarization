This paper develops and illustrates a state of the art, nature-inspired approach, to design car lines that optimize the degree of differentiation vs commonality among models in the line.
More specifically, we apply a swarm intelligence mechanism to stated preference data derived from a large-scale conjoint experiment that measures consumer preferences for passenger cars in a sample of 1164 individuals.
The proposed two-step methodology is also incorporated into a prototype system, which has been developed in an attempt to facilitate managerial decision making.
Our approach provides interesting insights into how new and existing car models can be combined in a product line and identifies the desired balance between differentiation and commonality levels among models within a product line, which elevates customer satisfaction.
