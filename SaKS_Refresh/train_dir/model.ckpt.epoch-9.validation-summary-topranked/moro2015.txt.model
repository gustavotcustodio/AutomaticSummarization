This paper analyzes recent literature in the search for trends in business intelligence applications for the banking industry.
Moreover, the latent Dirichlet allocation modeling was used in order to group articles in several relevant topics.
The analysis was conducted using a dictionary of terms belonging to both banking and business intelligence domains.
Such procedure allowed for the identification of relationships between terms and topics grouping articles, enabling to emerge hypotheses regarding research directions.
