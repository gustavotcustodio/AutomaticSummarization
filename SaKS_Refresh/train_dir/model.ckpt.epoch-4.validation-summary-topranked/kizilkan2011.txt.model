This study presents thermodynamic performance modeling of an experimental refrigeration system driven by variable speed compressor using artificial neural networks (ANNs) with small data sets.
Controlling the rotational speed of compressor with a frequency inverter is one of the best methods to vary the capacity of refrigeration system.
Instead of several experiments, the use of ANNs had been proposed to determine the system performance parameters based on various compressor frequencies and cooling loads using results of experimental analysis.
The backpropagation learning algorithm with two different variants was used in the network.
