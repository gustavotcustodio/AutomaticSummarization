The MDCSCN model benefits customers by providing direct products and services from available facilities instead of the conventional flow of products and services.
Sustainable objectives, i.e., reducing economic cost, enlarging customer coverage and weakening environmental influences, are involved in designing the MDCSN.
A modified multi-objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) algorithm is introduced to solve the MDCSCN model, which integrates the priority-based encoding mechanism, the Pareto optimality and the swarm intelligence of the bee colony.
The effect of the MDCSCN model are examined and validated through numerical experiment.
