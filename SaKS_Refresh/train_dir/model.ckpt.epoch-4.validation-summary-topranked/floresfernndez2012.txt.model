However, when used alone they show low sensitivity and specificity because lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease.
Recent reports have shown that simultaneous analysis of biomarkers has the potential to separate lung cancer patients from control subjects.
However, it has become clear that a universal biomarker panel does not exist, and optimized panels need to be developed and validated in each population before their application in a clinical setting.
In this study, we selected 14 biomarkers from literature, whose diagnostic or prognostic value had been previously demonstrated for lung cancer, and evaluated them in sera from 63 patients with lung cancer and 87 non-cancer controls (58 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients and 29 current smokers).
