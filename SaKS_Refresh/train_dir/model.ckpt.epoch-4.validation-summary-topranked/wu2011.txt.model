To improve the efficiency of diagnosis, several distinct tumor marker groups are combined together using a mathematical evaluation model, called artificial neural network (ANN).
Lung cancer markers have been identified to include carcinoembryonic antigen, carcinoma antigen 125, neuron specific enolase, Î²2-microglobulin, gastrin, soluble interleukin-6 receptor, sialic acid, pseudouridine, nitric oxide, and some metal ions.
Methods These tumor markers were measured through distinct experimental procedures in 50 patients with lung cancer, 40 patients with benign lung diseases, and 50 cases for a normal control group.
The most valuable were selected into an optimal tumor marker group by multiple logistic regression analysis.
