An analysis on the performance of the segmentation techniques, feature extraction methods, automatic feature selection (SFLA) and constructed classifiers (support vector machines, learning vector quantization and Naives Bayes) is done on the basis of accuracy, efficiency and elapsed time.
This analysis motivates towards the accurate determination of tumor grade from MR images instead of depending on magnetic resonant spectroscopy and biopsy.
Fuzzy c-means segmentation outperformed other segmentation techniques, shape and size based textural feature promoted the demarcation of tumor grades, Naive Bayes classifier succeeded in terms of efficiency, error and elapse time when compared with SVM and LVQ.
The study was carried out with 200 images consisting training set (164 images) and testing set (36 images).
