In this paper we compare three artificial intelligence techniques, decision trees, Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines, in order to evaluate their performance in the prediction of the seminal quality from the data of the environmental factors and lifestyle.
To do that we collect data by a normalized questionnaire from young healthy volunteers and then, we use the results of a semen analysis to asses the accuracy in the prediction of the three classification methods mentioned above.
The results show that Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machines show the highest accuracy, with prediction accuracy values of 86% for some of the seminal parameters.
In contrast decision trees provide a visual and illustrative approach that can compensate the slightly lower accuracy obtained.
