This study presents thermodynamic performance modeling of an experimental refrigeration system driven by variable speed compressor using artificial neural networks (ANNs) with small data sets.
Controlling the rotational speed of compressor with a frequency inverter is one of the best methods to vary the capacity of refrigeration system.
For this aim, an experimental refrigeration system was designed with a frequency inverter mounted on compressor electric motor.
The experiments were made for different compressor electric motor frequencies.
