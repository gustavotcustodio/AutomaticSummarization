Current solution strategies include Na√Øve Bayes (NB), Neural Network (NN), Linear Least Squares Fit (LLSF), k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM); with SVMs showing better results in most cases.
In this paper we introduce a new approach called dynamic architecture for artificial neural networks (DAN2) as an alternative for solving textual document classification problems.
DAN2 is a scalable algorithm that does not require parameter settings or network architecture configuration.
To show DAN2 as an effective and scalable alternative for text classification, we present comparative results for the Reuters-21578 benchmark dataset.
