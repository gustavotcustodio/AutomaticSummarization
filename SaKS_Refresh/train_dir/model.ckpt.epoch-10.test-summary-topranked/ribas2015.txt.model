Both have been proved to be very effective for the problem at hand.
The initialization scheme named HPF2(λ, μ) in particular, which is used to construct the initial food sources, is shown in the computational evaluation to be one of the main procedures that allow the DABC_RCT to obtain good solutions for this problem.
To find the best configuration of the algorithm, we used design of experiments (DOE).
This technique has been used extensively in the literature to calibrate the parameters of the algorithms but not to select its configuration.
