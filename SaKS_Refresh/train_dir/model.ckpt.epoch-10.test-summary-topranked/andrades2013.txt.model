The Medical and Pharmaceutical industries have shown high interest in the precise engineering of protein hormones and enzymes that perform existing functions under a wide range of conditions.
Proteins are responsible for the execution of different functions in the cell: catalysis in chemical reactions, transport and storage, regulation and recognition control.
Computational Protein Design (CPD) investigates the relationship between 3-D structures of proteins and amino acid sequences and looks for all sequences that will fold into such 3-D structure.
Many computational methods and algorithms have been proposed over the last years, but the problem still remains a challenge for Mathematicians, Computer Scientists, Bioinformaticians and Structural Biologists.
