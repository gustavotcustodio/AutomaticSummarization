Among them all, those methods using a population-based scheme, e.g.
the evolutionary algorithms, have been the most successful optimization strategies.
Recently, innovative population-based algorithms such as ABC, BBO, and HS have arisen as promising optimization methods due to they provide a good tradeoff between design and performance when compared to other more elaborated methods.
In this work, we aim to first introduce the particular design of these three cutting edge algorithms, and additionally analyse their performance when tackling a challenging real-world optimization problem.
