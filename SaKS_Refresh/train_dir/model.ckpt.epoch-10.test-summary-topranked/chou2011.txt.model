This study employs the Evolutionary Support Vector Machine Inference Model (ESIM) to predict the cost of manufacturing thin-film transistor liquidâ€“crystal display (TFT-LCD) equipment.
The ESIM is a hybrid model integrating a support vector machine (SVM) with a fast messy genetic algorithm (fmGA).
The SVM concerns primarily with learning and curve fitting, while the fmGA is focuses on optimization of minimal errors.
Recently completed equipment development projects are utilized to assess prediction performance.
