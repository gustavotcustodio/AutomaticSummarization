This paper proposes an extremum seeking control (ESC) scheme based on particle swarm optimization (PSO).
We also propose an algorithm that first reshuffles the sequence, and then inserts intermediate states into the sequence, in order to reduce the regulator gain and oscillation induced by population-based stochastic searching algorithms.
The convergence of the scheme is guaranteed by the PSO algorithm and state regulation.
Simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme.
