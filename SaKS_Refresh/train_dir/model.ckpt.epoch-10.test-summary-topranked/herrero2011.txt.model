They are based on Exploratory Projection Pursuit, Topology Preserving Maps and Curvilinear Component Analysis.
Two interesting real data sets are analyzed to empirically probe the robustness of these models.
The first case study describes information from a significant sample of Spanish multinational enterprises (MNEs).
Interesting conclusions are drawn from the application of several business intelligence solutions based on neural projection models, which support data analysis in the context of country and political risk analysis.
