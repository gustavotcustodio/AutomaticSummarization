Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a major role in modern video games by making them feel both more realistic and more fun to play.
In this paper, we define the genre of scripting video games and introduce Fuzzy Tactics, a video game we developed that has an innovative gameplay based on fuzzy logic and uses fuzzy rules as its core game mechanic and user interaction mechanism.
In Fuzzy Tactics, players lead their troops into battle by specifying a set of fuzzy rules that determines the battle behavior of the units.
Fuzzy logic is the only mean that players have to interact with the game and to command to their troops.
