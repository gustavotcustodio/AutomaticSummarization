Full factorial experimental design is implemented to increase the confidence limit and reliability of the experimental data.
Artificial neural networks (ANN) and multiple regression approaches are used to model the surface roughness of AISI 1040 steel.
Multiple regression and neural network-based models are compared using statistical methods.
In future researches, an economical study on a manufacturing facility may be conducted to investigate the benefits of implementing ANN and multiple regression models in the turning process.
