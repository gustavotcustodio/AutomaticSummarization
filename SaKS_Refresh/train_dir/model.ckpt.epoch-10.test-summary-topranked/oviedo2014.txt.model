This system aims to support and improve automatic telecontrol of solar power plants, by either automatically triggering actuators or dynamically giving recommendations to human operators.
For this purpose, the development of a MultiAgent System is combined with a variety of inference systems, such as Expert Systems, Neural Networks, and Bayesian Networks.
This diversity of intelligent technologies is shown to result in an efficient way to mimic the reasoning process in human operators.
The main feature for the correct functionality of a control system is the expert knowledge and how it is applied by humans.
