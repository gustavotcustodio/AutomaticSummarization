In the present study, performance of microbial fuel cell (MFC) has been modeled using three potential artificial intelligence (AI) methods such as multi-gene genetic programming (MGGP), artificial neural network and support vector regression.
The effect of two input factors namely, temperature and ferrous sulfate concentrations on the output voltage were studied independently during two operating conditions (before and after start-up) using the three AI models.
The data is randomly divided into training and testing samples containing 80% and 20% sets respectively and then trained and tested by three AI models.
Based on the input factor, the proposed AI models predict output voltage of MFC at two operating conditions.
