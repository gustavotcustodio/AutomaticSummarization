We concentrate on individual error rates for the four groups, i.e., we count the number of group 1 values classified into group 2, group 3, and group 4 and vice versa.
The results indicate that in general not only are MP, k-NN, and hybrid approaches relatively better at overall classification but they also provide a much better balance between error rates for the top customer groups.
The results also indicate that the MP and hybrid approaches provide relatively higher and stable classification accuracy under all the data characteristics.
Many a time practitioners are interested in not only the misclassification rates of classification methods but also the individual error rates exhibited by each of the classification methods.
