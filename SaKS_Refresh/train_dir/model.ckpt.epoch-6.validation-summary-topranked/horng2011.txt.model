Four different methods are compared to this proposed method: the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the hybrid cooperative-comprehensive learning based PSO algorithm (HCOCLPSO), the Fast Otsuâ€™s method and the honey bee mating optimization (HBMO).
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MEABCT algorithm can search for multiple thresholds which are very close to the optimal ones examined by the exhaustive search method.
Compared to the other four thresholding methods, the segmentation results of using the MEABCT algorithm is the most, however, the computation time by using the MEABCT algorithm is shorter than that of the other four methods.
Thresholding is one of the most important techniques for performing image segmentation.
