Unfortunately, due to both uncertainty and imprecision, the developed predictive modelings are less accurate compared to laboratory experimental core data.
This paper presents functional networks as a novel approach to forecast permeability using well logs in a carbonate reservoir.
The new intelligence paradigm helps to overcome the most common limitations of the existing modeling techniques in statistics, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence communities.
Future work can be achieved using different structure of functional networks with different basis, interaction terms, ensemble and hybrid strategies, different clustering, and outlier identification techniques within different oil and gas challenge problems, namely, 3D passive seismic, identification of lithofacies types, history matching, rock mechanics, viscosity, risk assessment, and reservoir characterization.
