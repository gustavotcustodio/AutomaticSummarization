This paper highlights the limitation of the methods used in forensics compared with a CBR method in the analysis of forensic evidences.
The design and development of an Intelligent Forensic Autopsy Report System (I-AuReSys) basing on a CBR method along with the experimental results are presented.
Our system is able to extract features by using an information extraction (IE) technique from the existing autopsy reports; then the system analyzes the case similarities by coupling the CBR technique with a Na√Øve Bayes learner for feature-weights learning; and finally it produces an outcome recommendation.
Our experimental results reveal that the CBR method with the implementation of a learner is indeed a viable alternative method to the forensic methods with practical advantages.
