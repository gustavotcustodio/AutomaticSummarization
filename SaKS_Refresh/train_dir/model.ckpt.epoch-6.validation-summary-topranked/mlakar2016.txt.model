Additionally a study of different evolutionary or swarm-based intelligence algorithms for the purpose of thresholding, with a higher number of thresholds was performed, since many real-world applications require more than just a few thresholds for further processing.
Experiments were performed on eleven real world images.
The efficiency of the hybrid was compared to the cuckoo search and self-adaptive differential evolution, the original differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony where the results showed the superiority of the hybrid in terms of better segmentation results with the increased number of thresholds.
Since the proposed method needs only two parameters adjusted, it is by far a better choice for real-life applications.
