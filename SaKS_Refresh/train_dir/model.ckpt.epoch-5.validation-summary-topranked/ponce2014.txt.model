Many audio signal applications are corrupted by noise.
Recent work provides that there exist some insights on using an artificial intelligence method called artificial hydrocarbon networks (AHNs) for filtering audio signals.
Thus, the scope of this paper is to design and implement a novel approach of artificial hydrocarbon networks on adaptive filtering for audio signals.
Three experiments were developed.
