Lung cancer is a public health priority worldwide due to the high mortality rate and the costs involved.
In recent years serum biomarkers have been proposed as a method that might enhance diagnostic capabilities and complement imaging studies.
However, when used alone they show low sensitivity and specificity because lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease.
In this study, we selected 14 biomarkers from literature, whose diagnostic or prognostic value had been previously demonstrated for lung cancer, and evaluated them in sera from 63 patients with lung cancer and 87 non-cancer controls (58 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients and 29 current smokers).
