We developed various artificial stock markets populated with different numbers of traders using a special adaptive form of the Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP)-based learning algorithm.
We used several econometric techniques to investigate the emergent properties of the stock markets.
We have found that the introduction of increased heterogeneity and greater genetic diversity leads to higher market efficiency in terms of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), demonstrating that market efficiency does not necessarily correlate with rationality assumptions.
Our empirical results, generated by a reduced number of boundedly rational traders in six of the stock markets, for each of the three financial instruments do not support the allocational efficiency of markets, indicating the possible need for governmental or regulatory intervention in stock markets in some circumstances.
