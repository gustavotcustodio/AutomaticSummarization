Image thresholding is a process for separating interesting objects within an image from their background.
This paper proposes a novel hybrid differential evolution algorithm for selecting the optimal threshold values for a given gray-level input image, using the criterion defined by Otsu.
The hybridization is done by adding a reset strategy, adopted from the Cuckoo Search, within the evolutionary loop of differential evolution.
The efficiency of the hybrid was compared to the cuckoo search and self-adaptive differential evolution, the original differential evolution, particle swarm optimization, and artificial bee colony where the results showed the superiority of the hybrid in terms of better segmentation results with the increased number of thresholds.
