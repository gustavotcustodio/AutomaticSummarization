There is a dearth of studies pertaining to the influence of SERVPERF on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty among low cost and full service airlines.
Prior studies have measured service quality using the GAP-5 model with SERVQUAL; however this study offers a new perspective by using the SERVPERF with an SEM–artificial-neural-networks predictive analytic approach.
This is different from the previous studies as it contributes to application of expert systems and intelligent algorithms in the context of low cost and full service airline.
The findings revealed significant influences of SERVPERF dimensions on customer satisfaction towards customer loyalty with 63.1% and 55.6% variance explained.
The implications from this research may help CEOs and managers of the air travel and tourism industry players to make better decisions in their resource planning stage, at the same time improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.
In the new era of the borderless world and modern society together with the emergence of low cost airlines, air travelling has been a kind of necessity rather than a luxury activity.
Due to the keen competition among global airliners, various marketing strategies and approaches have been employed to increase passenger and cargo traffic volume.
Nevertheless, global airline business has experienced a roller-coaster phenomenon during the last few years.
According to the CEO of Air Asia, the global airline industry has picked up its pace again in 2010 while the forecast for 2011 is encouraging though with element of caution (Air Asia, 2010 Annual Report).
The International Air Transport Association (IATA, 2014) has forecasted the industry’s net profit level from USD12.9 billion in 2013 to USD18.7 billion for 2014.
IATA further estimates a 5.3% in passenger growth (RPK) for 2013 and 5.8% for 2014 from 3.129 billions passengers to 3.304 billions in 2014.
In terms of the international revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), IATA has estimated a 6.1% growth while for the international freight ton kilometers (FTK), a 5.9% growth in 2013.
In the Malaysia airlines industry context, for the year 2010, it experienced a 12.4% growth of passenger traffic followed by a growth rate of 10.7% for 2011 and only 5% for 2012 (Maybank IB Research, 2013).
It surged to a 21-year record high of 18.4% in 2013 (Maybank IB Research, 2014).
The airline industry in Malaysia is dominated by full service Malaysia Airlines (MAS) as the national airline with 100 destinations worldwide and Air Asia as the first low cost carrier serving 75 destinations in 21 nations via its Air Asia X, Indonesia Air Asia and Thai Air Asia wings (Wong & Musa, 2011).
Air Asia has received the “Best Low-Cost Airline” category at Business Traveller Asia–Pacific’s 2012 annual Travel Awards ceremony in Hong Kong (The Star, 2012), the first ASEAN Commercial Aviation Award 2013 in Langkawi (The Star, 2013a) as well as the World’s Best Low Cost Airlines award for 2009 and 2010 from Skytrax and was voted as the top three Best Regional airlines in the low cost carrier category by Skytrax World Airline Award in 2006.
Lately, it has also won the award for World’s and Asia’s “Best Low-Cost Airlines” in the Paris 2013 World Airlines Award (The Star, 2013b) and the World Travel Awards Asia and Australasia in Dubai (The Star, 2013c) whereby MAS was also named as “Asia’s Leading Airline”.
The competition between the two airlines has been enormous especially with Air Asia promoting aggressively its tagline “Now Everyone Can Fly”.
In fact, the airline sector has been ascertained to be an intangible service industry by Clemes, Gan, Kao, and Choong (2008).
A good service quality (SQ) will lead to increase in profits (Buzzell & Gale, 1989) while maintaining an organization’s competitive advantage (Park, Robertson, & Wu, 2004).
Therefore, the impact of SQ on airline customers’ satisfaction and loyalty is worth studying as the findings would be beneficial to not only the two airlines but also other airlines worldwide in increasing their passenger traffic as well as improving the profitability.
Majority of the previous studies (Table 1) have focused on measuring airlines SQ using the SERVQUAL’s GAP-5 model.
Perhaps this research is among the first to ascertain the direct impact of the SERVPERF dimensions towards full service and low cost airlines’ (LCC) customer satisfaction (CS) and customer loyalty (CL) using a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)–artificial neural network predictive analytic approach.
“Predictive analytics are useful for generating new theory, developing new measures, comparing competing theories, improving existing theories, assessing the relevance of theories, and assessing the predictability of empirical phenomena” (Shmueli & Koppius, 2011, p. 554).
Finally, there are hardly any pervious studies that examine whether differences exist in the SERVPERF provided between full service and low cost airline.

Hence, three research questions were formulated: RQ1: What are the dimensions of service quality performance of the airline industry?
RQ2: Is there any significant difference between full service and low cost airlines in terms of construct validity of the SERVPERF dimensions and the causal relationships in the structural model?
RQ3: What is the impact of these service dimensions towards customer satisfaction of the airline industry?
This study aims to examine the impacts of the SERVPERF dimensions on customer satisfaction towards loyalty in airlines industry based on the above-mentioned research questions.
Hence, from the contextualization of the airline industry, there is no doubt that a study on the impacts of the SERVPERF dimensions upon customer satisfaction and loyalty is indeed very much relevant and imperative.
The remainder of the paper is arranged as such: – Presentation of the review of literature.
– Development of the hypotheses.
– Elucidation on research methodology.
– Elaboration of data analysis and results.
– Discussion of implications, conclusion, limitations and future studies.
Context for definitions The SERVPERF model is utilized in measuring its impacts on customer satisfaction and its indirect effects on the customer loyalty from the context of low cost and full service airline passengers.
SERVPERF consists of 5 dimensions namely tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy as shown in Fig 1.
Research model Fig 1.
Research model.
Service quality (SQ) Service quality (SQ) supports customers’ satisfaction while motivating recommendations and promoting intention to return (Nadiri & Hussain, 2005).
In return, customers’ satisfaction lead to rise in profitability, return of investment and market share (Legoherel, 1998; Stevens, Knutson, & Patton, 1995).
No wonder, SQ has been one of the hot topics of debate in the service literature (Ooi, Lin, Tan, & Chong, 2011).
SQ is generally defined as when the delivered service is able to meet customers’ expectations, requirements and satisfaction.
It is also defined as customers’ general impression of the comparative superiority or inferiority of a service or organization (Bitner & Hubbert, 1994).
Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1985) defined SQ as the discrepancy between consumers’ perceptions of services provided by a particular company and their expectations about companies offering such services.
Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry (1988) proposed a 22-item instrument composing five key elements in a SERVQUAL model.
These dimensions include (Parasuraman et al., 1988, p. 23): a.
“Tangibles – the physical environment embodied by objects (i.e.
interior design) and subjects (i.e.
the look of employees).
b.
Reliability – the service provider’s capability to offer precise and trustworthy services.
c. Responsiveness – a firm’s readiness to help its customers by providing swift and efficient service performance.
d. Assurance – miscellaneous features that give confidence to customers (i.e.
the firm’s particular service knowledge, courteous and trustworthy behavior of employees).
e. Empathy – the service firm’s willingness to offer each customer with individual service”.
The SERVQUAL gap model asserts that the customers’ evaluation of the general SQ is ascertained by the level and direction of the gap between what is expected and what is perceived of the actual performance.
One of the first few articles published on airline SQ were in 1988 (Gourdin, 1988); while the direct application of the SQ gap model emerged in 1991 (Fick & Ritchie, 1991; Gourdin & Kloppenborg, 1991).
Since then, many researchers (Table 1) have embarked on using this scale in airline industry.
Besides that, SERVQUAL model is also widely applied in various other sectors such as telecommunication (Oh, 1995), retail stores (Lee & Lee, 1997), financial services (Newman, 2001), health care (Kilbourne, Duffy, Duffy, & Giarchi, 2004), hotels (Juwaheer, 2004) and public sector (Wisniewski, 2001).
However, the SERVQUAL model has been criticized by Carman (1990, p. 44) who suggested that “it is better to collect data in terms of the perception/expectation difference directly rather than to ask about each separately.
It is also important to take into account the level of experience of the customer with the service”.
On the other hand, the SERVPERF model was introduced by Cronin and Taylor (1992) with the argument that SQ ought to be gauged as an attitude and supported the use of perception statements only in the SQ measurement.
Their findings revealed that SERVPERF explained more variation in the measurement of SQ in all the four service industries i.e.
dry cleaning, banks, fast food services, and pest control.
Hence, SERVPERF is employed in this study to assess the airline SQ.
Customer satisfaction (CS) Customer satisfaction (CS) may be defined as an individual’s perception either discontent or pleasure by comparing the perceived performance of a product with respect to one’s expectations (Lin, Chen, & Chiu, 2010).
Anderson, Fornell, and Lehmann (1994) defined CS as the overall evaluation based on the total purchase and consumption experience with a good or service over time.
Theoretically, SQ can also be described as the outcome of a subjective evaluation between what is expected and what is perceived for post-purchase accomplishments (Fecikova, 2004).
SQ motivates re-purchase intention (Cronin & Taylor, 1992; Fornell, 1992; Parasuraman, Berry, & Zeithaml, 1991a) and positive word-of-mouth (Rogerson, 1983) while retaining customers (Fornell, 1992) and securing CL (Selnes, 1993).
Nevertheless, the causal relationship between SQ and CS has been constantly debated with some researchers claiming that SQ leads to CS (Cronin & Taylor, 1992; Parasuraman et al., 1988) whilst others argued that CS is a determinant of SQ (Bolton & Drew, 1991; Oliver, 1980) and even some asserted that there is no relationship between SQ and CS (Fornell, 1992; Teas, 1993).
Therefore, a study on these causal relationships is indeed warranted to further ascertain these claims.
Customer loyalty (CL) Customer loyalty (CL) encompasses re-purchase intention, willingness to suggest to others a product or service and reluctance to change to another competitor (Cronin & Taylor, 1992).
It can be manifested in behaviors such as re-purchase intention (Cronin & Taylor, 1992; Fornell, 1992; Parasuraman et al., 1991a) or word-of-mouth (Cronin & Taylor, 1992; Selnes, 1993).
In order to retain CL and competitive advantage, it is essential that airline companies assess and revise their strategies from time to time (Abdullah, Manaf, & Noor, 2007).
For example, Natalisa and Subroto (2003) recommended that domestic airline companies should honor promises in their promotional campaign.
Chin (2002) stressed that CL can be raised through frequent flier programs; while Dick and Basu (1994) asserted that dependability and assurance will uplift CL.
Although CL is imperative for the survival of service companies, it needs to be studied further (Gremler & Brown, 1996).
Relationship between service quality and customer satisfaction The correlation between SQ and CS has been widely debated.
As mentioned above, some researchers claimed that SQ leads to CS while others either disagreed or argued that there is no relationship between these constructs.
Conventionally, SQ and CS have been deemed equated (Saha & Theingi, 2009).
SQ is assessed by a definite performance of a service with regard to a specific service attribute; while CS is evaluated by customer’s general experience of a service (Oliver, 1993).
To attain a higher level of CS, majority of the researchers recommended that a high degree of SQ ought to be delivered since it is considered as a determinant of CS (Cronin, Michael, Brady, & Hult, 2000; Cronin & Taylor, 1992).
Even though most researchers agree on the distinctiveness of the definitions for both constructs, the causal relationship is yet to be ascertained (Saha & Theingi, 2009).
Tangibles Parasuraman, Berry, and Zeithaml (1991b, p. 41) defined tangibles as “the appearance of physical facilities, equipment, personnel and communication materials”.
Aghdaie and Faghani (2012), Nadiri, Hussain, Ekiz, and Erdogan (2008), Kim and Lee (2011) and Lee, Lee, and Yoou (2000) discovered that tangibles may give significant positive impact on customer satisfaction.
In the context of airline industry, the tangible dimensions refer to physical condition of the carrier, the facilities and equipment installed, the appearance of the cabin crews, the food and beverages as well as reading entertainment materials provided on flight.
If these tangibles are inadequate, unavailable or in poor conditions, then most likely customers will not feel satisfied with the service of airline carrier.
Hence, the hypothesis is formulated: H1 Tangibles have significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction.
Reliability Reliability is described as “the ability to perform the promised service dependably and accurately” (Parasuraman et al., 1991b, p. 41).
Reliability has been found to have significant influence on customer satisfaction (Aghdaie & Faghani, 2012; Lee et al., 2000).
In terms of airline industry, reliability dimension is referred to as the degree to which a carrier is able to provide precise and trustable services as promised to the customers.
This includes flight schedule punctuality, accurate and up-to-date flight information, luggage safety and delivery, personal safety and security, contingency plans, etc.
If the level of reliability is high, customers will definitely be satisfied with the airline service.
Therefore, the hypothesis proposed is: H2 There is a significant and positive influence of reliability on customer satisfaction.
Responsiveness Responsiveness may be described as “the willingness to help customers and provide prompt service” (Parasuraman et al., 1991b, p. 41).
Responsiveness is a significant antecedent of customer satisfaction (Aghdaie & Faghani, 2012; Kim & Lee, 2011; Lee et al., 2000).
In the airline context, responsiveness refers to the promptness of action taken whenever there are requests or complaints from the customers.
Immediate action must be taken in order to provide the service assistance and help needed.
If the response time is poor then the service is deemed to be unsatisfactory and will leave a negative impact on the customer’s satisfaction.
Hence, the next hypothesis is as follow: H3 Responsiveness has a significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction.
Assurance Assurance can be described as “the knowledge and courtesy of employees and their ability to convey trust and confidence” (Parasuraman et al., 1991b, p. 41).
Previous studies (Clemes et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2000; Yi & La, 2003) have found that assurance poses a significant positive impact on customer satisfaction.
In the airline perspective, it is referred as the ability of a carrier to provide trust and confidence to the customers.
Moreover, the capability to exhibit credibility and courtesy will play a vital role in building customers’ confidence and trust.
This leads to the formation of the next hypothesis: H4 Assurance has a significant and positive influence on customer satisfaction.
Empathy Empathy is referred to as “the caring and individualized attention provided to the customer” (Parasuraman et al., 1991b, p. 41).
This dimension is referred to the carrier’s ability to provide individualized attention to the customers.
Empathy has been found to have significant effect on customer satisfaction (Aghdaie & Faghani, 2012; Clemes et al., 2008; Lee et al., 2000; Suki, 2014).
A cabin crew who has a high degree of empathy will have the ability to understand the feelings, needs and wants of their customers.
Customers will definitely feel appreciated and thus establishing a good interpersonal relationship.
Personal caring attention will create a comfortable environment for customers during the flight.
Thus, we would put forward the following hypothesis: H5 Empathy has a significant positive influence on customer satisfaction.
Customer satisfaction and customer loyalty CL is defined as “the degree to which a customer recommends, and expresses a preference for future use of a particular company” (Dean, 2007, p. 163).
CL maybe manifested in the form of re-purchases intention, word-of-mouth (WOM) communication and recommendations made of the company (Nadiri et al., 2008).
WOM is defined as “the informal communication between consumers about the characteristics of a business or a product” (Kau & Loh, 2006, p. 103).
In the context of the airline industry, re-purchase intention refers to customers’ plans to fly in their next trip.
Studies have shown that higher the CS, higher the re-purchase and WOM communication (Davidow, 2003; Ekiz & Arasli, 2007).
Therefore, the following hypothesis is put forward: H6 Customer satisfaction has a significant and positive influence on CL.
Sample and collection procedures Initially, a pre-test was carried out with two professors to ascertain the face and content validity of the survey questionnaire.
Then a pilot test was conducted with 30 passengers to evaluate the questionnaire in terms of wording, clarity, relevancy and time spent.
Finally, a cross-sectional survey questionnaire was administered to 350 passengers at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) for duration of two weeks via convenience sampling technique.
Out of these, 50 questionnaires were unusable as they were incomplete.
Hence the response rate is 85.7% using the similar computation method as Cheng, Chen, and Chang (2008) and Chen and Chang (2005).
Convenient sample was engaged as there is no sampling frame available and the passengers in KLIA are most likely the customers of Air-Asia or MAS.
Furthermore, it is also in accordance with the approach used by Cheng et al.
(2008), Chen and Chang (2005) and Lindenmeier and Tscheulin (2008).
Besides that, according to the airport, the profile of the respondents is quite similar with the frequent flyers of the airport in terms of gender, age, marital status and occupation (Chen & Chang, 2005).
Variable measurements 4.2.1.
Independent variable: SERVPERF measures To ascertain construct reliability and validity of the independent variable (SERVPERF dimension), 22 items were adapted from past studies shown in Table 2.
A 7-point Likert scale was employed to measure the level of agreement for every item starting from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7).

Dependent variables: customer satisfaction and customer loyalty Two dependent variables namely CS and CL were measured with a 7-point Likert scale starting with 1 for strongly disagree to 7 for strongly agree.
There were 4 items for CS and 4 items for CL which were all adapted from previous studies to guarantee construct reliability and validity.
Data analysis 4.3.1.

Statistical analysis To examine the causal relationship between the constructs, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) was performed and analyzed with AMOS 18.
A two-stage procedure was applied to the measurement (CFA) model and the structural model as recommended by Hair, Black, Babin, and Anderson (2010), Leong, Hew, Tan, and Ooi (2013), Leong, Ooi, Chong, and Lin (2013) and Wang, Tsai, and Tsai (2014).
The first stage involves the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) that identifies the underlying constructs, which is then followed by the second stage of confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to ascertain the causal relationship between these constructs via path analysis (Kaplanidou & Vogt, 2006; Liu et al., 2014; McGehee, Lee, O’Bannon, & Perdue, 2010; Nunkoo, Ramkissoon, & Gursoy, 2013; Palmer, Koenig-Lewis, & Medi Jones, 2013; Ramkissoon, Graham Smith, & Weiler, 2013; So, King, Sparks, & Wang, 2014; Swanson & Horridge, 2004; Zopiatis, Constanti, & Theocharous, 2014).
Testing the assumptions of multivariate analysis Several multivariate assumptions are required in an SEM analysis.
These include normality of dataset, multicollinearity, linearity, outliers, bias, construct reliability and validity, adequate sample size, convergent and discriminant validity.
As the sample size for this research is 300, it is adequate for the SEM analysis (Hair et al., 2010).
Common latent factor with AMOS 18 revealed a shared variance of 2.56% implies non-existence of common method variance whereas the Mahalanobis d2/independent variables <3 indicates non-existence of multivariate outliers (Lee, Ooi, Tan, & Chong, 2011).
The maximum absolute values of skewness and kurtosis are 0.689 (<±1) and 0.434 (<±2) respectively (Kline, 2005; Leong, Hew, Ooi, & Lin, 2011; Tan, Siah, Ooi, Hew, & Chong, 2015).
The histograms, normal P–P and Q–Q plots of regression standardized residual further verified the existence of normality while scatter plots verified linearity (Tan, Ooi, Chong, & Hew, 2014).
The largest Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is 3.547 (<10) and the smallest tolerance is 2.282 (>0.1).
All correlation coefficients are below 0.8 indicating no occurrence of multicollinearity (Kline, 2005; Teo, Tan, Ooi, Hew, & Yew, 2015).
Construct unidimensionality and reliability To examine the unidimensionality of every construct, Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI) for each construct is evaluated.
Table 5 shows that GFI values ranged from 0.967 to 1.000 which is greater than the 0.90 threshold (Prajogo & Hong, 2008) indicating a good unidimensionality of the constructs.
The construct reliability (alpha) ranges from 0.850 to 0.898 were greater than the recommended threshold of 0.70 (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994).
Composite reliability (CR) which uses the actual factor loadings instead of the equal weight for all the constructs was also calculated.
The CR values ranged from 0.862 to 0.894 with all the factor loadings significant at p < 0.001.
Besides that Average Variance Extracted (AVE) was also calculated with value ranging from 0.602 to 0.726.

Measurement model – confirmatory factor analysis Construct validity measures the level to which “a scale measures what it intends to measure” (Hew & Leong, 2011, p. 21).
During the CFA stage, convergent and discriminant validity were verified (Chen & Chen, 2014; Lee, 2013).
Convergent validity describes the ability of the construct to measure what it is supposed to measure.
Fornell and Larcker (1981) asserted that convergent validity is attained if all the AVEs are greater than 0.50, all the CRs are greater than 0.70 and all the factor loadings are significant.
As shown in Table 5 all these criteria were satisfied, indicating the constructs in the battery have successfully passed the convergent validity test.
Discriminant validity, on the other hand, describes the level of the construct and its indicators to be different from other constructs and their respective indicators.
Kline (1998) suggested that to examine discriminant validity, the correlation coefficients should range between 0.10 and 0.90.
Table 6 shows that this criterion was fulfilled.
Discriminant validity is obtained as the AVE of a construct is larger than the square root of its correlation coefficients with other constructs (Leong, Hew, Ooi, & Lin, 2012; Teo, Cheah, Leong, Hew, & Shum, 2012) as shown in Table 6.
Furthermore, chi-square difference test (Zait & Bertea, 2011) was also performed and the result showed that all constructs were significantly different.
Hence, for the measurement model, both the reliability and validity of the constructs have been successfully verified.

Continuing from the first order measurement model, a second order measurement model based on the mean values of the indicators of each construct was also developed.
To assess the fitness of the measurement model with the dataset, ten goodness of fit measures were used namely the normed chi-square, p-value, Goodness-of-Fit Index (GFI), Adjusted Goodness-of-Fit Index (AGFI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), Incremental Fit Index (IFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) and Standardized Root Mean Residual (SRMR).
As illustrated in Table 7, all these measures (χ2/df = 0.680, p = 0.606; GFI = 0.997; AGFI = 0.987; CFI = 1.000; NFI = 0.998; IFI = 1.000; TLI = 1.000; RMSEA = 0.000; SRMR = 0.0074) exceeded the recommended thresholds (Hu & Bentler, 1999).
Thus, it may be concluded that the measurement model is able to fit very well with the dataset.

Comparison of group invariance between low cost and full service airlines The comparison between the low cost and full service airlines is done based on results of the multiple group analysis (MGA).
In order to perform MGA, chi-square test was used and a significance in the difference of the chi-square value between the configural model (unconstrained) and the constrained model (where all paths were constrained to equal for both groups) implies existence of differences between the two groups (Byrne, 2010; Feng, Prajogo, Tan, & Sohal, 2006).
To establish whether a significant difference exists, the difference in chi-square value and degree of freedom is compared to the critical value of the chi-square test at 0.05 level .
If it is larger than this critical value then there is significant difference between the groups.
Table 8 indicated no significant difference exists between the full service and low cost airlines for all the constructs of the SERVPERF model except for the reliability dimension.
This indicates that most of the constructs of the SERVPERF model are robust across both full service and low cost airlines.
Table 9 further verifies the group invariance of the measurement model of the SERVPERF dimension and thus there are no differences in terms of construct validity across the two groups.
In terms of causal relationship difference in the structural model across the groups, although the chi-square difference test (Table 9) indicated a significant difference but upon closer inspection, it was found that these differences were not on the six hypothesized paths whereby all the critical ratios for differences (Table 10) for these paths have absolute values less than 1.960 at p < 0.05 (Byrne, 2010).
Hence, a generalization can be made that no significant differences exist in terms of the causal relationships between the two groups.

FS – full service carrier; LC – low cost carrier; TA = tangibles; RL = reliability; RP = responsiveness; AS = assurance; EM = empathy; CS = customer satisfaction; CL = customer loyalty.
Structural model Similar to the measurement model, ten goodness-of-fit measures were used to gauge the goodness-of-fit of the structural model.
As reported in Table 7, all the measures (χ2/df = 0.697, p = 0.675; GFI = 0.995; AGFI = 0.982; CFI = 1.000; NFI = 0.997; IFI = 1.000; TLI = 1.000; RMSEA = 0.000; SRMR = 0.0067) exceeded the recommended thresholds.
Hence, the structural model was able to fit very well with the collected data.
Hypothesis testing In the path analysis, significance of a path is determined based on its p-value.
Fig 2 shows the standardized path coefficient (β) with p-value in bracket together with the corresponding variance explained by the model (R2).
The results implied that 63.1% of the variance in CS is explained by the relevant SERVPERF dimension while CS is able to explain 55.6% of the variance in CL.
As demonstrated in Table 11, the findings further reveal that tangibles (β = 0.304, p < 0.001), reliability (β = 0.271, p < 0.001) and responsiveness (β = 0.247, p < 0.001) have significant and positive impact on CS while CS (β = 0.924, p < 0.001) positively impacted on CL.
Therefore, H1, H2, H3 and H6 were supported.

*p < 0.001; TA = tangibles; RL = reliability; RP = responsiveness; AS = assurance; EM = empathy; CS = customer satisfaction; CL = customer loyalty.
However, assurance (β = 0.051, p = 0.473) and empathy (β = 0.099, p = 0.099) did not show significant impact on CS.
Hence, H4 and H5 were not supported.
Besides that, based on the two-tailed significance of the bias-corrected percentile method using bootstrapping (Table 12) there were indirect effects of tangibles (0.369), reliability (0.315) and responsiveness (0.276) on CL.
This indicates that CS mediates the causal relationship between tangibles, reliability, responsiveness and CL.
However, there were no significant indirect effects of empathy and assurance on CL.

Artificial neural network analysis Although SEM has been commonly applied in verifying hypothesized causal relationships, it has been rarely combined with other expert systems or artificial intelligence algorithms (Chong, 2013a; Hsu, Shih, Huang, Lin, & Lin, 2009; Wong, Law, & Yau, 2011).
Since SEM is only able to examine linear relationships, it may sometimes oversimplify the complexities involved in the human decision making processes.
To properly address this issue, ANN is incorporated in identifying the non-compensatory and non-linear relationships in the research model as it is capable to learn complex linear and non-linear relationships between SERVPERF dimensions and customer satisfaction.
Previous linear and compensatory model has the likelihood to assume that the shortfall in one of the predictors can be compensated by improving other predictors.
For example, the shortfall in responsiveness towards customer satisfaction may be compensated by the improved reliability, empathy or other SERVPERF dimensions.
However, compensatory model may not be applicable to the SERVPERF dimensions as these dimensions are entirely different and have different impacts towards customer satisfaction.
Through the identification of non-linear relationship, ANN will be able to examine the non-compensatory effects of SERVPERF on customer satisfaction.
Besides that, ANN is capable of producing more accurate predictions compared to the traditional regression techniques such as SEM, logistic, multiple and discriminant regression (Chiang, Zhang, & Zhou, 2006; Chong, 2013a; Leong, Hew, et al., 2013; Morris, Greer, Hughes, & Clark, 2004).
Generally, artificial neural network (ANN) refers to a device that is made to model the manner in which human brain conducts a specific function or job through the use of electronic components or computer software simulation.
ANN is described as “a massively parallel distributed processor made up of simple processing units, which has a natural propensity for storing experiential knowledge and making it available for use” (Haykin, 1999, p. 24).
“ANN is made up of a large number of simple processing elements known as nodes or neurons” (Palmer, José Montaño, & Sesé, 2006, p. 782).
Compared with traditional linear models such as MRA, SEM, Logistic Regression and Multiple Discriminant Analysis, ANN is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that has outperformed these models as it has the ability to detect both linear and nonlinear relationships with high predictive accuracy (Leong, Hew, et al., 2013).
Besides, ANN requires no multivariate assumptions such as normality, linearity or homoscedasticity to be fulfilled (Lee, Leong, Hew, & Ooi, 2013).
Even with these advantages, NN is not so suitable for causal relationship hypothesis testing due to its “black-box” operating nature and since linear models (e.g.
SEM, MRA) have the possibilities of over-simplifying the complexities in decision making processes (Sim, Tan, Wong, Ooi, & Hew, 2014), the use of the SEM–ANN approach in this study would complement each other.
Hence, in this study, the significant determinants from the SEM analysis were employed as the input variables for the ANN analysis.
For this study, we have engaged multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with Feedforward-Back Propagation (FFBP) algorithm where the input signals are fed in forward direction while the error signals propagate in backward direction.
The MLP consists of three layers i.e.
input, hidden and output layers.
In order to avoid over-fitting, a ten-fold cross validation with data partition of 90:10 for training and testing was conducted using SPSS 21.
The number of hidden neurons was generated automatically and the sigmoid function was used for both output and hidden layers (Tan, Ooi, Leong, & Lin, 2014).
The relevance of the predictor variables was validated based on the number of non-zero synaptic weight connected to the hidden layer (Table 13).
Table 13.
Relevance of predictor variables based on at least one non-zero synaptic weight with hidden neurons.
Input Neural networks variable NN1 NN2 NN3 NN4 NN5 NN6 NN7 NN8 NN9 NN10 TA RL RP Note: The symbol indicates that the variable is relevant; TA = Tangible, RL = Reliability, RP = Responsiveness.
Root Mean Square of Error (RMSE) was used in assessing the accuracy of the NN model while the normalized importance for each predictor was calculated in the sensitivity analysis (Table 14).
The mean RMSE values range from 0.0742 to 0.0819, which indicate a high predictive accuracy.
Based on the sensitivity analysis, responsiveness was reported to be the most essential determinant of customer satisfaction followed by tangibles and reliability.

The use of the two-stage predictive-analytic (Scott & Walczak, 2009; Shmueli & Koppius, 2011) SEM–neural network analysis may provide a more holistic understanding and thus may provide significant methodological contribution from the statistical point of view.
This is because the non-compensatory neural network analysis is able to complement the weaknesses of the compensatory and linear SEM analysis.
The study will open up another new perspective in understanding the impact of SERVPERF on customer satisfaction between low cost and full service airlines based on the results of the multiple group analysis.
This is one of the significant additional contributions to the existing literature in the sense that expert system or artificial intelligence was applied in a new context of service quality on customer satisfaction of low cost and full service airlines.
This is different from the contexts of previous studies on m-commerce adoption (Chong, 2013a), inter-organizational system standard adoption (Chan & Chong, 2012), open IOS adoption (Chong & Bai, 2014), NFC-enabled mobile credit card acceptance (Leong, Hew, et al., 2013), mobile music acceptance (Sim et al., 2014) and mobile learning acceptance (Tan et al., 2014).
The differences in the order of the service quality dimensions on customer satisfaction between the SEM and the ANN analyses are expected as the SEM analysis is capable of analyzing only compensatory linear relationships whereas the ANN is more robust and is capable of analyzing both compensatory linear relationships and non compensatory and non linear relationships.
Due to these differences, the order of regression weights from the SEM may not be the same as the order of normalized importance from the ANN.
These differences are similar to those of Chan and Chong (2012), Chong (2013a,b), Chong and Bai (2014) and Sim et al.
(2014).
Based on the fact that ANN has out-performed other traditional regression techniques such as SEM, logistic, multiple and discriminant regression (Chiang et al., 2006; Chong, 2013a; Morris et al., 2004), the normalized importance of the predictors obtained from the ANN analysis were used instead of the SEM regression weights.
Tangibles The results of the ANN analysis revealed that tangibles are the second important predictor of CS.
This is in agreement with Abdullah et al.
(2007), Ariffin, Salleh, Aziz, and Asbudin (2010), Ling and Lin (2005), Nadiri et al.
(2008) and Saha and Theingi (2009).
It has the strongest direct impact on CS besides having the strongest indirect effect on CL.
Therefore, airlines need to ensure that the physical conditions of their aircrafts, facilities and equipment as well as the reading and entertainment materials provide in-flight and the appearance of their cabin crews are always tip-top.
It is only with the utmost environment, customers will be satisfied with their journey.
Since tangibles also have a strong significant indirect effect on CL, airlines need also put ample priority and attention in terms of the tangibles dimension so that existing customers can be retained, thus ensuring long term CL so that they will be able to sustain the competitive advantages.
Reliability In the study, reliability was found to have a significant direct impact on CS although it is the third important predictor after responsiveness and tangibles.
This is in accordance with Abdullah et al.
(2007), Ariffin et al.
(2010), Cunningham, Young, and Lee (2002), Ling and Lin (2005) and Nadiri et al.
(2008).
Hence, the airlines need to ensure that their products and services are always trustable and reliable.
This can be done by providing punctuality in flight schedules, ensuring safety of luggage and their deliveries, guaranteeing the safety and security of their passengers, providing the accurate and up-to-date flight information and quick actions on contingency plans whenever there are emergencies or mishaps.
Constant and periodical monitoring and supervision is required on all the tangibles of the carrier as a way to maintain the highest level of physical condition and appearance.
The superiors need to immerse themselves through walkabouts from time to time to personally check that all the tangibles are in good condition.
Since reliability also has the second strongest indirect effect on CL, airline airlines should always provide the best reliable products and services in order to build the confidence of their customers.
When customers have their confidence towards the carrier, they will consider to re-patron with the same carrier in future.
This will lead to resistance to switch to other competitors and hence retaining CL.
Responsiveness Responsiveness was found to have the most important predictor of CS which is consistent to Ling and Lin (2005), Abdullah et al.
(2007), Nadiri et al.
(2008) and Ariffin et al.
(2010).
Therefore, airlines need to consider provision of swift and prompt services in order to meet customers’ demands.
Instant assistance and help required whenever there are requests or complaints from the customers.
In order to address this issue, constant and periodical trainings are required for all cabin crews and ground staffs regarding the response time and responsive actions in various situations.
Besides that, airlines should always provide a channel in the form of customer service evaluation form, suggestion boxes, customer feedback form, email, etc as a way of measuring the responsiveness of their workers.
Assessment may also be done by the superiors to evaluate their workers response time and actions.
Responsiveness also indirectly poses a significant effect on CL and thus airlines need to put due attention to ensure that customers are loyal to their company.
This will reduce turn-over rate of customers to their competitors while sustaining the competitive edge.
Assurance Assurance has insignificant direct impact on CS.
It contradicts to the studies carried out by Abdullah et al.
(2007), Cunningham et al.
(2002), Ling and Lin (2005) and Nadiri et al.
(2008).
Such a finding can be justifiable by the high level of knowledge and courtesy among the cabin crew of the airlines.
For example, the excellent services of MAS and Air Asia have been proven by the various awards presented to both MAS and Air Asia.
In fact, MAS won the “Staff Excellence Service for Asia” and “World’s Best Economical Class” awards at the World Airline Awards in Hamburg (World Airline awards, 2010) and “Asia’s Leading Airline” award at the World Travel Awards Asia and Australasia in Dubai (The Star, 2013c).
Air Asia won the “World’s Best Low-Cost Airline” award for the third consecutive year in 2011 (World Airline awards, 2011).
Therefore, customers do not perceive assurance as a factor in determining their satisfaction towards a carrier.
Based on these track records, airlines need to maintain a high level of assurance with their customers so that their customers are always satisfied and loyal to them.
Besides, no significant indirect effect was detected of assurance on CL.
Hence, customers do not perceive assurance as a factor in determining their loyalty towards the carrier.
Their decisions were indirectly influenced by tangibles, reliability and responsiveness of the SERVPERF dimensions as elucidated above.
Empathy Empathy is reported to have an insignificant impact on CS and it is contrary to Abdullah et al.
(2007), Nadiri et al.
(2008) and Ariffin et al.
(2010) but in agreement to Ling and Lin (2005).
The insignificant impact may be due to the customers’ perception that they are well understood and they have been receiving adequate individual attention and care from the cabin crew and hence do not consider empathy as a factor in determining their satisfaction towards the carrier.
Another reason is that due to keen competition in airline industry, most airlines have given considerable focus to provide individual and personal attention and care to their customers as a strategy of customer retention.
“Customer First” is the favorable tagline among most of the airlines.
Moreover, no significant indirect effect was reported of empathy on CL whereby customers do not consider it to be vital in determining their loyalty to a carrier.
Customer satisfaction The research revealed that CS has a very strong direct impact on CL.
This is in line with Clemes et al.
(2008), Nadiri et al.
(2008) and Saha and Theingi (2009).
Hence, airline companies need to ensure that each and every one of their passengers is satisfied with the products and services provided in order to guarantee future re-patronage and uphold customer loyalty.
In order to achieve this objective, they should provide a good channel or platform for customers to express their gratitude and satisfaction regarding the products and services received.
For instance, customer feedback form, survey questionnaire, short face-to-face interview or satisfaction ballot box are among the recommendations to be considered.
Besides, online surveys, telephone interviews and emails interview may also be other options to gather information pertaining to customers’ satisfaction.
Then based on the feedback information, the carrier may further improvise and upgrade their products and services so that the degree and gratification among their customers may be further elevated and airlines aim to get customer enlightenment.
Theoretical implications Theoretically, this research has been able to move forward the literature pertaining to the impact of SQ and CS on CL of the airline industry.
The research is among the first to examine these impacts using the SERVPERF model with a multi-stage SEM–neural network approach in both full service and low cost airlines.
Besides, the mediation effects were also studied based on the indirect effects of the SEM analysis.
In addition, the model is among the first to be tested for group invariance between full service and low cost airlines and was found to be robust across both groups.
Thus the conceptual model of this study may be used as a source of reference for other researchers who are interested in studying the impact of SQ on both CS and CL.
Managerial implications In terms of managerial implications, the empirical findings obtained from this study can contribute to CEOs and managers of the airline industry by providing them the vital information about the dimensions of the SERVPERF model that affects SQ as well as the importance of sustaining SQ in order to raise CL.
Since tangibles were found to be an important antecedent of CS, an extra effort is required to ensure that the physical conditions of their aircrafts, equipment and facilities as well as the appearances of their staffs are in the top forms.
Utilizing the Total Quality Management (TQM) system together with the implementation of the ISO 9000 standards may be some of the options.
Providing reliable products and services are among the other important factors to be well addressed.
Airline companies are subjected to the evaluation on reliability by their customers.
Due to the high competitiveness of the airline industry, any slack or shortcoming in this area will surely lead to unwanted results.
Therefore, internal assessment and auditing should be carried out in order to measure the level of reliability.
External measures such as survey form, face-to-face short interview, online or telephone survey, email feedback, etc are among the options to be chosen.
By entertaining these pieces of feedbacks, airlines need to take the necessary actions to remedy any shortcomings so that the degree of reliability is tip-topped.
To stay competitive, a carrier may also provide fast and responsive services to their customers.
Responsiveness is imperative to ensure CS.
Hence, evaluation and assessment must be conducted periodically to ascertain the high level of responsiveness among its workers.
Simulations and mock tests may be done to check the level of responsiveness such as response time, response actions, ability to act depending on various unexpected situations, etc.
Besides that, feedback form, survey questionnaire, interview, etc may also be used to gather information regarding the degree of responsiveness among the workers.
Last but not the least, airline airlines need to ensure that CS is always sustained as it is the important antecedent to CL.
It is only with satisfaction, customers will become loyal to them.
In this perspective, they must change their strategies every now and then to suit the requirements and wants of the customers in order to keep them satisfied.
To achieve this aim, key performance indicators (KPI) may be introduced to all workers so that the performance of each worker can be systematically assessed.
Sometimes, it is inevitable to use the “Hire and Fire” policy to ensure that only the best workers stay and only the best products and services are offered.
This research empirically investigate SERVPERF’s influence on both CS and CL among the full service and low cost airlines in the Malaysian airline industry, with a further examination on whether a significant difference lies between full service and low cost airlines in terms of construct validity of the SERVPERF dimensions.
In response to first research question (RQ1), the dimensions of service quality performance of the airline industry chosen for this research are tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance and empathy.
As for the second research question (RQ2), no significant difference was reported to exist between full service and low cost airlines for all SERVPERF constructs except for the reliability component.
Furthermore, no significant differences exist in terms of causal relationship difference in the structural model across the two groups.
As for the impacts of SERVPERF dimensions towards customer satisfaction of the airline industry, tangibles, reliability and responsiveness were found to have a direct, significant and positive impact on CS.
At the same time these indirectly impact on CL as well.
While assurance and empathy pose no direct and significant impact on CS and no indirect significant impact on CL, thus answering the third research question (RQ3).
One of theoretical contributions of this research is the use of expert systems and artificial intelligence systems (i.e.
ANN) in the new context of low cost and full service airlines compared to other existing studies on m-commerce adoption (Chong, 2013a), inter-organizational system standard adoption (Chan & Chong, 2012), open IOS adoption (Chong & Bai, 2014), NFC-enabled mobile credit card acceptance (Leong, Hew, et al., 2013), mobile music acceptance (Sim et al., 2014) and mobile learning acceptance (Tan et al., 2014).
Furthermore, the use of SERVPERF instead of the well-studied SERVQUAL dimensions using multiple group analysis may provide better understanding from a new perspective.
With the predictive analytic (Scott & Walczak, 2009; Shmueli & Koppius, 2011) SEM–ANN approach, the study may also provide methodological contribution in terms of statistical analysis techniques.
Several limitations were found in this research.
Firstly, this research was conducted in a developing ASEAN country and hence the results may not be able to generalize to other geographical regions.
Future research can overcome such limitation by carrying out a cross-country comparative study.
Secondly, it used a cross-sectional survey approach and thus the effect of time was not examined.
It is suggested that in future, a longitudinal survey may be conducted.
The research used the SERVPERF model and this has limited representation, therefore, in future other SQ models such as SERVPEX (Robledo, 2001), weighted SERVPERF and SERVQUAL (Jain & Gupta, 2004) may be deployed to examine their impacts on CS and CL.
It would be an interesting finding if a research could be carried out on the unprecedented aviation event such as the mysterious lost of the Malaysian Airline Boeing 777 Flight MH370 (The Star, 2014) on customer loyalty.
Finally, in future, a study on the impact of customers’ character traits on CS and CL may also be conducted.
