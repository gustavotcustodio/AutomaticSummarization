This study applies multiple regression analysis and an artificial neural network in estimating the compressive strength of concrete that contains various amounts of blast furnace slag and fly ash, based on the properties of the additives (blast furnace slag and fly ash in this case) and values obtained by non-destructive testing rebound number and ultrasonic pulse velocity for 28 different concrete mixtures (Mcontrol and M1–M27) at different curing times (3, 7, 28, 90, and 180 days).
The results obtained using the two methods are then compared and discussed.
The results reveal that although multiple regression analysis was more accurate than artificial neural network in predicting the compressive strength using values obtained from non-destructive testing, the artificial neural network models performed better than did multiple regression analysis models.
The application of an artificial neural network to the prediction of the compressive strength in admixture concrete of various curing times shows great potential in terms of inverse problems, and it is suitable for calculating nonlinear functional relationships, for which classical methods cannot be applied.

The compressive strength (CS) of concrete is unknown during the early life of a structure.
In addition, because the concrete market is generally highly competitive, companies commonly have limited budgets for mix design, even though such information is of great importance to site operations and the structure to be built.
Furthermore, to obtain the desired concrete strength with suitable workability in the laboratory, technical personnel must investigate several mix proportions.
This time-consuming procedure results in the wastage of material and increased cost of concrete production (Oztas et al., 2006).
The current empirical equations presented in codes and standards for estimating the CS of concrete are based on tests of concrete without supplementary cementation material.
It is therefore important to investigate the validity of these relationships for concrete that contains supplementary cementation material (e.g., fly ash and blast furnace slag).
The more we known about the relationship between concrete composition and strength, the better we can understand the nature of concrete and how to optimize the concrete mixture (Yeh, 1998).
The assessment of concrete structures using non-destructive techniques (NDT) is of interest to engineers worldwide.
Such tests are easy to carry out because they require little or no sample preparation and the testing equipment is simple (Kahraman, 2001; Qasrawi, 2000).
They can be applied to concrete structures in the field, and are easily performed with little cost.
The evaluation of concrete strength is usually based on empirical relations between strength and NDT parameters.
NDT methods are commonly required for the prediction of CS, especially given the generally limited nature of available laboratory facilities (Qasrawi, 2000).
The manufacturers of NDT devices usually provide details of the empirical relationship between strength and NDT parameters relevant to their testing system.
Such relationships are not suitable for every type of concrete; therefore, they must be calibrated for different mixtures (Nehdi, Chabib, & Naggar, 2001; Trtnink, Kavcic, & Turk, 2009).
Among the available NDT methods, ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) and rebound hammer (RN) testers are most commonly used in practice.
An artificial neural network (ANN) is an application of artificial intelligence that has recently been widely used in many areas of science and engineering to model human activities (Saridemir, Topcu, Ozcan, & Severcan, 2009).
Traditional prediction models were developed with a fixed equation based on a limited number of data and parameters.
If new data are somewhat different from the original data, then it is necessary to update not only the coefficients in the model but also the form of its equation.
In contrast, ANN does not require an equation with a specific form; instead, it requires sufficient input–output data.
An ANN can continuously re-train the new data, meaning that it can conveniently adapt to new data (Lee, 2003).
Many studies have sought to predict the CS of concrete using ANN, and several authors have used ANN in applications in structural engineering (Ghaboussi & Joghataite, 1995; Rogers, 1994).
The use of additives in cement has shown a dramatic increase in recent years because of economical, technical, and environmental considerations.
Blast-furnace slag (BFS), which has been widely used as an additive in cement and concrete, has the advantages of high lateral strength, good durability, and chemical stability, among others.
BFS is produced as a waste product from both ferrous and nonferrous metals industries.
Cement with high BFS contents has low strength at early curing times because of the slow hydration reaction of slag.
Unlike fly ash (FA), the reactivity of slag is dependent on temperature (Miura & Iwaki, 2000).
FA is generally used as a replacement for cement, as an admixture in concrete, and in the manufacture of cement.
It has been recommended that concrete should contain no more than 40% FA (Neville, 1995), as FA mixes require a longer period to develop strength.
Two processes govern the reaction rate of slag during the initial period of hydration: the nucleation and growth rate of hydration phases, which are dependent on the initial lime content, and the phase boundary interactions that occur between existing and newly formed compounds.
It must be appreciated that mix design is ultimately an inverse problem: i.e., the selection of constituent proportions starting from the desired properties.
Although ANNs have been used to solve inverse problems, such an approach is complicated in the case of the design of concrete mix because of the large number of causal factors compared with just a few dependent factors (e.g., strength) (Dias & Pooliyadda, 2001).
Recent studies (Kasperkiewicz, Racz, & Dubrawski, 1995; Nehdi et al., 2001) have proposed a new method of mix design and predicting the strength of concrete using a neural network, although it has not been fully developed into an intelligent system for predicting the temporal development of concrete strength (Qasrawi, 2000), especially admixture concrete for practical use.
Lai and Sera (1997) developed a neural network model for predicting the strength of concrete using seven quantitative variables related to composition (amounts of fine and coarse sand, fine and coarse aggregate, cement, water, and superplasticizer) and using the type of cement as a qualitative variable.
Saridemir et al.
(2009) predicted the strength of concrete containing BFS using a neural network and fuzzy logic.
However, no previous studies have investigated concrete that contains both FA and BFS.
ANN performance was also compared with that of multiple regression analysis (MRA), using both linear and exponential models.
This comparison was made to establish whether the ANN approach represents a genuine improvement over MRA, especially as MRA modelling has been used for some time (Abbasi, Ahmad, & Wasim, 1987) and because it has the advantage of generating easy-to-use regression constants and estimating the significance of the various input variables.
Unlike in regression analysis, in ANN there is no need for a priori knowledge of the functional relationships among the variables.
ANN automatically constructs the relationships for a given network architecture as experimental data are processed through a learning algorithm.
This approach is “data driven,” meaning that the network adapts to the training data to capture the relationship among input and output parameters (Oreta, 2004).
For this reason, ANN is of interest to engineers and scientists as a tool in modelling and predicting the behaviour of both engineered and natural systems.
In the course of this study, different methods were utilized to predict the CS of 27 admixture concretes (M1–M27) with varying amounts of FA and BFS.
MRA and ANNs were applied in predicting CS parameters using data gathered in the present study.
First, different mix proportions (i.e., varying amounts of Portland cement, FA, and BFS, for various curing times) were used.
This study considers the CS properties of admixture concrete prior to production.
Thereafter, properties determined using NDT methods (RN and UPV) were used in predicting CS.
Thus, CS properties can be determined without damage to the samples or structures of interest.
Aggregate Crushed and cleaned limestone aggregate was used in the present experiments, obtained from Tertiary Ceyhan (Adana, Turkey) limestone.
The rock is generally well indurated, massive, brittle, and gray in color.
The aggregate was crushed to sizes of 0–5, 5–10, and 10–20 mm, depending on the mixing ratio.
Aggregate grading affects the workability of concrete; here, the grading of mixed aggregate complied with the requirements of BS 812 (1991).
The chemical composition of the crushed limestone is given in Table 1.
Several mechanical properties of aggregate are of interest, especially when the aggregate is to be used in construction or is subjected to high wear.
The mechanical and physical properties of the aggregate are presented in Table 2.
These properties were determined according to International Society for Rock Mechanics (1981) methods.

Cement Ordinary Portland cement (PC 42.5 MPa) produced in the Adana Cement Factory, Turkey, was used in this study.
The PC conforms to the current specifications described in BS 12 (1996).
The specific gravity of the cement was 3.11 g/cm3.
Initial and final setting times of the cement were 200 and 270 min, respectively, and its Blaine specific surface area was 3100 cm2/g.
The proportion of cement remaining on 90 and 45 μm sieves was 0.3% and 3.8%, respectively.
The chemical composition of the cement is given in Table 1.
Blast-furnace slag BFS is a non-metallic co-product produced in the manufacturing of iron.
It is a glassy granular material formed when molten BFS is rapidly cooled by direct contact with water.
Rapid cooling prohibits the formation of crystals, thereby forming glassy, non-metallic silicates and aluminosilicates of calcium.
The use of BFS to replace a portion of PC in a concrete mixture is a useful method to improve the properties and consistency of the concrete, resulting in improved workability, easier finish ability, higher compressive and flexible strengths, lower permeability, improved resistance to aggressive chemicals, more consistent plastic and hardened properties, and lighter colour.
The BFS used in the present experimental study was obtained from the Iskenderun OYSA Cement Factory, Turkey.
Its specific gravity and Blaine specific surface area were 2.87 g/cm3 and 4500 ± 500 cm2/g, respectively.
The proportion of BFS remaining on 90 and 45 μm sieves was 0.3% and 3.9%, respectively, and its chemical composition is given in Table 1.
Fly ash The FA used in this study was obtained from the Sugözü Thermal Power Station in the town of Yumurtalık, Adana province, southern Turkey.
According to ASTM C 618 (1992) specifications, the FA used as an additive in cement concrete is classified into two general types: class C and class F. Three major oxides (SiO2 + Al2O3 + Fe2O3) must make up more than 50% of the material for class-C FA, and more than 70% for class F. The FA used in the present study was classified as class F (SiO2 + Al2O3 + Fe2O3 = 86.10%).
The ASTM C 618, BSI 3892 and EN 450 standards restrict the SO3 content of FA to below 5%, 2.5%, and 3%, respectively.
In addition, the ASTM C 618 and BSI 3892 standards restrict the MgO content of FA to below 5% and 4%, respectively.
The FA used in the present study satisfied all of these requirements (Table 1).
The proportion of FA remaining on a 45 μm sieve, which is considered an indication of fineness, was 7.5%.
EN 450 and ASTM C 618 require that the fineness of FA should be no greater than 40% and 34%, respectively; however, BSI 3892 requires a maximum value of 12.5%.
The FA employed in the present study satisfied all of these standards.
The loss on ignition (LOI) of FA is also regulated by standards: BSI 3892, ASTM C 618, and EN 450 state a maximum LOI of 7%, 12%, and 5%, respectively.
The FA used in the present experimental study has an LOI value of 2.78%.
A high carbon content in concrete is considered to interfere with hydration reactions, as well as reducing its workability and increasing the water demand (Neville, 1995).
Twenty-seven concrete mixtures (M1–M27) were prepared with additives of FA and BFS, with a water:cement ratio of 0.32, 300 dosages, and grading sizes of 0–5 mm (33%), 5–10 mm (8%), and 10–20 mm (40%) of crushed limestone aggregate.
Regular tap water was used in all mixtures.
All specimens were prepared in a small factory using pressure and vibration until complete compaction was obtained.
The mixtures were prepared in a power-driven revolver-type drum mixer with a capacity of 0.40 m3.
The mix proportions are given in Table 3.
All concrete specimens were prepared in a small factory, applying pressure and vibration until complete compaction was obtained, followed by curing at a constant temperature of 20 ± 2 °C and relatively humid of 65 ± 5%.
The specimens were subjected to local environmental conditions.
All the specimens were tested after curing times of 3, 7, 28, 90, and 180 days.

Compressive strength The CS properties of the concrete mixtures were determined according to standards proposed by ASTM C 39 (2001).
At least five core samples from each concrete mixture were subjected to strength tests performed by a fully automatic, instrumented and computer-controlled press machine.
Table 4 lists the CS values of the concretes containing different proportions of PC, FA, and BFS under various curing times.
Mcontrol corresponds to PC concrete.
The strength of all mixtures showed an increase with age.
Generally, the rate of increase in the CS of all samples at 3, 7, and 28 days was markedly less than that at 90 days.
The samples showed lower strength than the corresponding control concrete, except for the M16 mixture, which had higher strength than the control mixture at day 90.
High CS was acquired during the early stages of hydration, when the FA content of reached 10–20%.
This finding indicates that although FA activity is low, it affects the early strength development.
This plays an important role in controlling the early strength of the concrete.
In the later hydration stage, slag activation and hydration have a positive effect on strength development, and the degree of FA hydration decreases.

The CS of the concrete containing BFS was higher than that of equivalent concrete made with FA, reflecting a higher ratio of water to cementation material in the latter than in the former.
In turn, this directly resulted from the high LOI of FA, which results in high water demand for the mixtures.
Moreover, the concrete containing 30–50% BFS as cement replacement developed higher CS than did the concrete containing the same amount of FA.
The best results in terms of the CS of the concrete were obtained for the M16 mixture, which contained 50% PC, 10% FA, and 40% BFS.

Ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) The velocities of P (compressional) waves were measured in cylindrical core samples using the high-frequency ultrasonic pulse technique described by International Society for Rock Mechanics (1981), employing transmitter and receiver transducers (each 50 mm in height and diameter) and a nominal frequency of 1 MHz.
The receiver was positioned on a plane opposite to that upon which the transmitter was placed.
The transducers were energized from the pundit instrument through the switch unit.
The transducers were placed in face-to-face contact with soft lead-foil discs of 50 and 0.05 mm thickness placed between the transducers to ensure good acoustic contact.
The specimen was placed between the foil discs.
The velocities of P waves were calculated from the measured travel time and the distance between the transmitter and receiver.
Fig 2 shows a strong relationship between UPV and the CS of admixture concrete, with a correlation coefficient of 0.85.

Rebound Number (RN) A rebound hammer is useful for rapidly surveying large areas of similar types of concrete in the construction of interest.
Neville (1995) summarized the benefits of using the rebound number in concrete, and proposed that the test used alone is not a strength test and that exaggerated claims of its use as a replacement for a compression test should not be accepted (Qasrawi, 2000).
The rebound number has been used previously for testing the quality of concretes and rocks.
Schmidt hammer models are designed with different levels of impact energy, and types L and N are commonly adopted for determining the properties of rock and concrete.
Type L has an impact energy of 0.735 N m, which is just one-third that of type N. The Schmidt hammer is widely used in the prediction of UCS (Kahraman, 2001; Sachpazi, 1990; Sheorey, Barat, Das, Mukherjee, & Sing, 1984).
Rebound tests of the concrete specimens were performed using an N-Type Digi-Schmidt 2000 apparatus according to the procedures described in ASTM C 805 (1997) and BSEN 12504:2 (2001).
At least 20 measurements were taken at different points upon each mixture sample.
Fig 3 shows a moderately strong exponential relationship between RN and the CS of admixture concrete, with a correlation coefficient of 0.73.
Relationship between rebound number and the compressive strength of admixture… Fig 3.

For statistical analyses, multivariable linear regression analysis (MRA) was employed.
The purpose of MRA is to simultaneously identify two or more independent variables that explain variations in the dependent variable.
The general MRA equation is given below, with the dependent variable being a linear function of more than one independent variable.
(1) where Y is the dependent variable; α is the Y-intercept; β1, β2, and βk are the slopes associated with Xa, Xb, and Xk, respectively; Xa, Xb, and Xk are the values of the independent variables; and e represents the error.
For prediction of the CS of admixture concrete before production, CS is considered as a dependent variable, while the proportions of PC, BFS and curing time are independent variables (Table 5, Model 1).
FA was not considered to avoid the problem of multicollinearity.
Regression analysis generally requires a strong correlation between the independent and dependent variables.
Conversely, a strong correlation between independent variables, known as “multicollinearity,” leads to problems with the analysis.
There is no single preferred or accepted way of overcoming the problem of multicollinearity, as it arises due to the nature of the data.
When the amount of FA additive is reduced, BFS is increased by a similar amount, and vice versa.
Therefore, an inverse linear correlation exists between FA and BFS; in such a case, when two variables measure the same property, one variable should be dropped from consideration because little information is lost by doing so.
In Table 5, Model 2 was developed to predict the CS of concrete produced using PC with BFS (FA content = 0), whereas Models 3 and 4 were developed to predict the CS of concrete produced using PC with FA (BFS content = 0).
For Model 5, the independent variables are PC, BFS, Age, RN, and UPV.
In Model 6, developed to predict the CS of admixture concrete without damage, RN and UPV are independent variables.

The enter techniques in the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) were used to develop the regression models.
MRA employs a procedure for selecting variables in which all the variables in a block are entered in a single step.
The number of statistical parameters is associated with the MRA.
Some of the most important parameters include the coefficient of regression determination, the coefficient of correlation, the adjusted coefficient of determination, the standard error of the regression coefficient, the confidence level, standard error, model error, the significance level, the t-distribution, the F-distribution, and the residual.
Detailed explanations of these parameters can be found in previous studies (Myers, 1990; Tukey, 1997).
As a final approach, a multinomial model is developed to predict the CS of admixture concrete based on mixture properties and NDT methods.
As a summary of the regression models, Table 5 lists the statistical parameters calculated at the 95% confidence level, as this level is commonly used in analyses of statistical data.
Predictive models of CS, as derived by MRA, are as follows: (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) where CS is the compressive strength (MPa), PC is the content of Portland cement (%), BFS is the content of blast furnace slag (%), FA is the content of fly ash (%), age is the curing age (days), UPV is the ultrasonic pulse velocity (M/s), and RN is the rebound number.
The validity of the models was assessed by considering the following criteria: behaviour of the correlation coefficient (R) and determination coefficient (R2), the t-test, the F-test, and the Durbin–Watson test.
The statistical results obtained for all models are given in Table 5.
The correlation coefficient for Model 1 appears to lie in an acceptable range (R2 = 0.76).
The values of the multivariable regression determination coefficient (R2) for Models 2–6 are all similar and appear to lie in an acceptable range (R2 = 0.88, 0.90, 0.89, 0.87, and 0.82, respectively).
A high value for the coefficient of regression does not necessarily indicate the superiority of the model.
The value of R2 does not establish the validity of a model unless the results of an t-test, F-test, and Durbin–Watson test indicate consistency between the model and experimental results.
MRA was coupled with an analysis of variance or the F-test.
The analysis of variance was used to determine the significance of the deviation from linearity and non-linearity for the established regression lines; in other words, the analysis of variance helped to determine whether the regression line was the most suitable curve in representing the relationship between the sample data sets of two correlated variables.
The null hypothesis was designated Ro = 0, which states that no correlation exists between the two variables tested using analysis of variance.
The analysis of variance produced two values for each model: an F-value, which indicates the degree to which the regression equation fits the data, and a second value that indicates the statistical significance of the F-value.
In the case that the latter value was less than 0.05 at the 95% confidence level, Ro = 0 was rejected, meaning that the relationship between CS and the target independent variable could be expressed as a linear or non-linear equation at the 95% confidence level.
Otherwise, it was assumed that the relationship could not be represented as a regression model.
Because the significance of F-values was less than 0.05 for all models (Table 5), the null hypothesis was rejected in each case, and the models are considered to be valid.
The t-test was used to examine the significance of the variables in each model at the 95% confidence level.
By considering the degrees of freedom for each variable, a t-value calculated for the experimental data can be compared with a tabulated t-value.
If the computed t-value is greater than the tabulated value, the significance of t-values was less than 0.05 at the 95% confidence level and the variable is considered to be significant to the model.
All regression models were tested and all models (except Models 2 and 3) were verified by analysis of variance (Table 5).
For Model 2, the t-significance value of UPV exceeds 0.05 (0.296), and for Model 3 the t-significance value of RN exceeds 0.05 (0.106), indicating uncertainty regarding the validity of these models.
Consequently, based on the obtained t-significance values, it is concluded that all the models are valid except for Models 2 and 3.
The Durbin–Watson test was used to assess the degree of multicollinearity.
Ideally, Durbin–Watson values should be between 1.5 and 2.5.
As shown in Table 5, the Durbin–Watson value for Model 1 is less than 1.5, indicating uncertainty regarding the validity of this model.
For the other models, the obtained Durbin–Watson values are between 1.5 and 2.5, consistent with the ideal range of values; thus, these models are unaffected by problems related to multicollinearity.
Model 1 is invalid because of multicollinearity problems, and Models 2 and 3 were not verified by the t-test in MRA.
Figs.
4–6 show the values of CS predicted by Models 4–6, respectively, compared with values observed in laboratory tests.
In all cases, the data points are distributed uniformly about the r = 1 line, suggesting that the models are reasonable and reliable for practical applications.
These regressions also show strong correlations between the calculated and predicted values, with coefficients of determination (R) of 0.95, 0.93, and 0.91 for models 4–6, respectively.
Using Model 4 (which includes FA, Age, and UPV), it is possible to predict the CS of admixture concrete that contains BFS at various curing times; using Model 5, it is possible to predict the CS of admixture concrete with PC and BFS at various proportions, and with various values of Age, RN, and UPV; and using Model 6, it is possible to predict the CS of admixture concrete with various values of UPV and RN.

An artificial neural network (ANN) is a family of massively parallel architectures that can be used to solve difficult problems via the cooperation of highly interconnected but simple computing elements (or artificial neurons) (Yeh, 1998).
Neural networks are simplified models of the biological structure of the human brain.
ANNs are based on the principle that a highly interconnected system of simple processing elements can learn the nature of complex interrelationships between independent and dependent variables.
As shown in Fig 7, an ANN is a parallel distributed processing system consisting of an input layer, an output layer, and one or more hidden layers connected by neurons.
Each neuron is a processing element (PE) that receives one or more inputs and produces an output signal through the transfer function.
Associated with each connection is a weighting that expresses the effect on the current process element of an input set or another process element in the previous layer.
The connection weighting and bias values are initially chosen as random numbers and then fixed by the results of the training process.
Typical architecture of a multilayer perceptron neural network Fig 7.

Many training processes are available, including back propagation (BP) and cascade correlation (CC) schemes.
The goal of any training algorithm is to minimize the mean square error (MSE) between predicted and observed outputs and to maintain the good generality of the network.
The generality (network performance) is assessed by testing each new data set.
A satisfactory learning process can be achieved by choosing an appropriate network configuration with regard to the number of hidden layers and their hidden neurons.
The function of hidden layer neurons is to detect the relationship between network inputs and outputs (Rogers, 1994).
The choice of hidden layer size is a problem to be solved, and to some extent depends on the number and quality of training patterns.
There is no general rule for selecting the number of neurons in the hidden layer.
The number of neurons in an ANN must be sufficient for correct modelling of the problem of interest, but it should be sufficiently low to ensure generalization of the network.
Previous studies have related the number of neurons to the number of input and output variables and the number of training patterns (Rogers, 1994; Swingler, 1996); however, these rules cannot be generalized (Alshihri, Azmy, & El-Bisy, 2009).
Other researchers have proposed that the upper bound for the required number of neurons in the hidden layer should be one more than twice the number of input points; however, again, this rule does not guarantee generalization of the network.
To design a stable BP network, it would be more appropriate to carry out a parametric study by changing the number of neurons in the hidden layer and testing the correspondingly changing stability of the ANN.
Generally, a neural network is created for two or three phases, commonly referred to as “training,” “validation,” and “testing.” Training is presented to the network during training, and the network is adjusted according to the obtained errors, and sample data (both inputs and desired outputs) are processed to optimize the network’s output and thereby minimize deviation.
Validation is used to measure network generalization, and to halt training when generalization ceases improving and testing has no effect on training, thereby providing an independent measure of network performance during and after training.
In this study, the ANN toolbox (nftool) in the program MATLAB was used to perform the necessary computations.
A back-propagation training algorithm was utilized in a two-layer feed-forward network trained using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm.
If the trust-region algorithm does not produce a reasonable fit and does not sufficiently constrain the coefficients, the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm should be employed (Levenberg, 1944; Marquardt, 1963).
The back-propagation algorithm, which is one of the most widely used algorithms for a multilayer perceptron, is a gradient descent technique that minimizes the error for a particular training pattern in which it adjusts the weighting by a small amount each time (Oztas et al., 2006).
In the present study, a non-linear hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function was used in the hidden layer and a linear transfer function in the output layer.
The momentum rate and learning rate were determined and the model was trained through multiple iterations.
Six different models with varying mix proportions and testing methods were considered in terms of predicting the strength of admixture concrete using the ANN approach (Table 6).
The learning, validation, and testing phases employed 70%, 15%, and 15% of the data sets (selected randomly), respectively.
The number of neurons in the hidden layer was determined by training several networks with different numbers of hidden neurons and comparing the predicted results with the desired output.
The connection weightings and biases for all models are given in Table 7.

For Models 1–5, high regression R-values of 0.94, 0.99, 0.99, 0.97, and 0.95 were obtained, respectively (Table 8).
For Model 6, a moderate regression R-value of 0.89 was obtained.
In ANN modelling, there is no need for a priori knowledge of the functional relationships among the variables (Oreta, 2004), and the ANN approach has been used to solve inverse problems (Dias & Pooliyadda, 2001).
There exists a strong correlation between CS with UPV and RN, and this is not an inverse problem.
The prediction of CS using ANN is rarely used compared with multivariable linear regression analysis because MRA has the advantages of requiring no software, generating easy-to-use regression constants, and estimating the significance of the various input variables.
Consequently, optimized parameters for Model 6 are not given in Table 7.

The data reveal that all the proposed ANN models except Model 6 are suitable, with predicted CS values being similar to experimentally derived values.
In this study, 27 different mixtures of PC, FA, and BFS were prepared and tested after curing times of 3, 7, 28, 90, and 180 days.
Compressive strength was also determined.
The highest strength and rebound hardness were obtained for concrete containing around 50% PC, 10–20% FA, and 20–50% BFS.
The properties of the concrete showed a general improvement with the addition of 10–20% of class-F FA; however, the properties showed a decline as the FA content increased beyond 30%.
The CS of concrete containing BFS was higher than that of concrete with FA.
CS was predicted using MRA and ANN.
Admixture concrete was analyzed due to the wide variation in mix proportions and applied NDT.
CS was initially predicted by MRA using six different models; subsequently, six different ANN models were applied.
The basic principles of these approaches were reviewed, their advantages and disadvantages assessed, and a variety of models were developed and their performances compared.
Model 1 was created to predict the CS of admixture concrete before production using MRA.
Models were developed to predict the CS of concrete produced using PC with FA (BFS content = 0) (Model 2) and using PC with BFS (FA content = 0) (Models 3 and 4), and models were developed for use with NDTM and production parameters (Model 5) and for use solely with NDTM (Model 6); all of these models were tested using statistical methods.
According to the results of the Durbin–Watson test and the t-test, uncertainty exists regarding the validity of Models 1–3.
Using Model 4, which takes into account FA, Age, and UPV, it is possible to predict the CS of admixture concrete that contain BFS at different curing times.
Using model 5, it is possible to predict the CS of admixture concrete consisting of varying proportions of PC and BFS, for various values of Age, RN, and UPV.
Using Model 6, it is possible to predict the CS of admixture concrete for various values of UPV and RN.
The coefficients of determination (R2) for models 4–6 are 0.89, 0.87, and 0.82, respectively.
To create the ANN models, a back-propagation training algorithm was utilized in a two-layer feed-forward network trained using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm.
A non-linear hyperbolic tangent sigmoid transfer function was used in the hidden layer and a linear transfer function was used in the output layer.
High regression R-values were obtained for models 1–5 (0.94, 0.99, 0.99, 0.97, and 0.95, respectively).
The regression values obtained for ANN were higher than those for MRA, except for Model 6, for which a moderate regression R-value was found (0.89).
ANN was used to solve inverse problems, and a strong correlation exists between CS with UPV and RN, which is not an inverse problem.
This result for Model 6 indicates that MVRA is a valuable method of predicting CS in combination with NDTM.
The performance of the tested ANN models in predicting CS (except for Model 6) exceeded that of MRA, based on comparisons of performance indices.
The results also reveal that the ANN approach performs well in predicting CS in the case of admixture concrete with various mix proportions; however, if an ANN model with wide applicability is desired, it is necessary to develop a larger and more varied training database.
The prediction of CS using ANN is currently rarely employed compared with MRA because the latter approach has the advantages of requiring no software, generating easy-to-use regression constants, and estimating the significance of the various input variables.
The application of ANN to the prediction of CS in admixture concrete at different curing times (3, 7, 28, 90, and 180 days) is particularly suitable in terms of calculating nonlinear functional relationships, for which classical methods cannot be employed.
