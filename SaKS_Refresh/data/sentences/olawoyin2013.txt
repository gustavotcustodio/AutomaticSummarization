The utilization of mathematical and computational tools for pollutant assessment frameworks has become increasingly valuable due to the capability to interpret integrated variable measurements.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are considered as dependable and inexpensive techniques for data interpretation and prediction.
The self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised ANN used for data training to classify and effectively recognize patterns embedded in the input data space.
Application of SOM–ANN is useful for recognizing spatial patterns in contaminated zones by integrating chemical, physical, ecotoxicological and toxicokinetic variables in the identification of pollution sources and similarities in the quality of the samples.
Water (n = 11), soil (n = 38) and sediment (n = 54) samples from four areas in the Niger Delta (Nigeria) were classified based on their chemical, toxicological and physical variables applying the SOM.
The results obtained in this study provided valuable assessment using the SOM visualization capabilities and highlighted zones of priority that might require additional investigations and also provide productive pathway for effective decision making and remedial actions.
Environmental media such as water, soil and sediments are susceptible to contaminations from various sources and substances, consequently leading to complexities in risk assessment decision making and management.
Integrated quality assessment measures of these media using comprehensive procedures that entail the toxicity and toxicity identification, bioaccumulation, biomagnifications, persistence, chemistry, evidence of effects and physical property evaluation of these pollutants are important (Chapman, 2007; Chapman & Hollert, 2006; Martı´n-Dı´az, Blasco, Sales, & DelValls, 2004).
The provision of significant integrated interpretations using high powered computing and artificial intelligence in assessing pollution levels is essential in setting priorities for mitigations and management measures that are needed for site restoration.
Integration of physical, chemical and toxicological datasets by means of establishing and characterizing the relationship between variables using multivariate techniques have been reported in several literature (Cesar et al., 2007; Morales-Caselles, Kalman, Riba, & DelValls, 2007; Simeonov et al., 2007; Van Den Brink & Kater, 2006).
Organic pollutants such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and the polychlorinated napthenes (PCNs) have been effectively characterized in contaminated regions (Mai et al., 2003) using multivariate analytical methods (Yunker et al., 1999) such as; the principal component analysis (PCA) with varimax rotation, multi-component decision making (MCDM) methods, and the hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) (Bostrom et al., 2002; Dahle, Savinov, Matishov, Evenset, & Næs, 2003; De Luca et al., 2004; De Miguel, Iribarren, Chacon, Ordonez, & Charlesworth, 2006; Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2007; Jarosinska, Biesiada, & Miszynska-Graca, 2006; Mielke, Gonzales, Smith, & Mielke, 1999; Mielke, Berry, Mielke, Powell, & Gonzales, 2004; Ng, Chan, Lam, & Chan, 2003; Sharma & Reutergardh, 2000).
Other studies have applied these techniques for the interpretation of metal contaminations in sediments and soils (Araújo et al., 2002; Carrizales et al., 2006; Chatterjee et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2003; Rowat, 1999; Shine, Ika, & Ford, 1995; Vidovic, Sadibasic, Cupic, & Lausevic, 2005).
Nadal, Schumacher, and Domingo (2004) used the SOM–ANN which is capable of unsupervised learning for the classification of metal contaminations in soil.
Remarkable SOM methods have been used in water quality assessment researches for pollutant sources identification, pattern recognition and classification (Lee & Scholz, 2006; Esen, Ozgen, Esen, & Sengur, 2009).
The anthropogenic impacts of industrial activities have been appraised by employing the ANN–SOM learning algorithm for the identification and interpretation of the relationships between the measured variables and collected river sediment samples, improving the knowledge of contamination sources and potential harm to humans (Marengo et al., 2006).
SOMs have been used in image classification (Lu, 1994), speech recognition (Kohonen, 1988; Hamzaçebi, Akay, & Kutay, 2009), clustering of documents (Honkela, Kaski, Kohonen, & Lagus, 1998).
Comprehensive references to the SOM techniques can be found in Kohonen (1985) and Kohonen, Hynninen, Kangas, and Laaksonen (1995).
The study area, the Niger Delta area (NDA) is located in the south southern part of Nigeria, (Fig 1).
Samples were collected from five different regions in the area; Bonny, Eriemu, Odidi, Ugehlli and Warri (Fig 2).

This research focus was on the valuable and suitable capability and application of the ANN–SOM technique for the classification, interpretation and visualization of water, soil and sediment data.
This was vital in analyzing the contaminants concentrations, bioaccumulation, toxicity and also assess the quality of the sampled materials.
Sampling sites and data set In this study, data was collected from 103 sampling sites of surface and underground water, sediments and soils distributed over three regions in the NDA (Fig 1).
Several samples were collected in Bonny huge petrochemical activities and an estimated population of 20,000 inhabitants.
Other areas with relatively large populations and with history of physical pollution such as the Eriemu, Odidi and Ughelli areas were also sampled in the study.
The datasets analyzed in this study include physico-chemical variables such as; SO4, PO4, Zn, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni, Mn, Fe, the sum of 7 carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) , the sum of 10 non-carcinogenic PAHs , sum of total petroleum hydrocarbon , sum of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene (BTEX) , and 2 toxicity parameters (pH and EC).
The heavy metals were analyzed using extraction methods consistent with US EPA method 3050B.
PAHs were treated using mass spectrometry detection (MSD) (González-Piñuela, Alonso-Salces, Andres, Ortiz, & Viguri, 2006).
Details on sample collection are presented in previous chapters and also described by Viguri et al.
(2007) and Olawoyin, Oyewole, and Grayson (2012).
The characteristics of the PAHs analyzed and the abbreviations are presented in Table 1.

Self-organizing map (SOM) The Mathworks software (Matlab®) and SOM Toolbox version 2 was used for the SOM analysis (Vesanto, Himberg, Alhoniemi, & Parhankangas, 1999).
The input data was the measured variables and the values for all locations.
The SOM tool was applied to project the input data (with multi-dimensions) into 2-dimensional lattice structure by going through a training phase and also preserving the topological features in the input data space.
The methodology of the SOM involves the arrangement of neurons on a 2-D grid, where each neuron is associated with a prototype weight vector that carries the resemblance of the input data variables.
The SOM used in this study was trained using the batch training algorithm as described in Kohonen (2001).
The variables obtained from the analyzed samples are presented as vectors in the input space to the SOM network all together (batch training,).
The methodology used in this study is presented in Fig 3.
The computation began by running several iterations where the individual distance between the input vector and each weight vector (Euclidean distance) is calculated and the neuron weight with the shortest distance representative of an input vector is chosen as the best neuron called the best matching unit (BMU).
The weights are updated at each time step, then the resultant weight vectors becomes the weighted averages of the vectors presented in the input space.
In the training phase, the SOM exhibits adaptive flexibility by folding into the input data clouds (Vesanto et al., 1999).
The performance which eventually generates similar neurons (BMUs) specifically located in the output space (on a grid in form of maps) based on the measured distances relative to the input vectors.
Methodology of the study using SOM–ANN Fig 3.
Methodology of the study using SOM–ANN.
SOM provides effective results which are easily visualized and interpreted from the generated component planes (CPs) and maps.
In this study, based on the variables measured from the samples collected from the locations (Fig 4), samples in the same unit will show more similarities and represented closer on the map, while samples with different patterns are located far away from each other.
Units with same weight vectors are represented on the same CP, therefore producing CP equal to the number of the data variables.
Preliminary assessment of the CPs explains the pattern embedded in the data and how the values spread in the input space.

Transformation of the input data with normalization techniques using the SOM algorithm was applied.
It is essential to normalize the variables since the SOM processing involves the measurement of distances from one vector to another (Vesanto et al., 1999).
Logarithmic transformation was applied to the input data using the function “log” while the mean of the individual variables in the input space were normalized to zero and the variance to unity using the function “var”.
The values of the variables were linearly transformed and scaled zero to unity using the function “range”.
These three normalization procedures were applied to each input datasets before presenting to the SOM learning regime.
The resolution of the map is measured with the use of the quantization error (QE), which measures the difference in the distance (average) between the BMU and each unit in the input data space (Kohonen, 2001), while the amount of every data vector whereby there is no adjacency between the first and second BMU is measured using the topographic error (TE) (Kiviluoto et al., 1996), this preserves the topology of the data.
For each normalization technique, TE and QE are considered to facilitate the selection of the map size, the minimized values of TE and QE that is close to the input data size represent the most suitable map size for the SOM learning and training processes.
It is vital to select the appropriate map size; the problem of over fitting may ensue if the number of samples is smaller than the number of map units (Lee & Scholz, 2006).
On the other hand, if the number of map units is much smaller than the number of samples, detailed information might be lost in the process (Leflaive, Céréghino, Danger, Lacroix, & Ten-Hage, 2005; Paliwal & Kumar, 2009).
In this study, the optimum map sizes were chosen for the network training after several trials with other sizes, the TE and QE were used to measure the suitability and fitness (quality) of the optimized map size.
Samples classification with SOM Crude oil is a complex mixture of chemicals and other substances, primarily hydrocarbons and porphyry of metals and also organic substances.
Sediment mineralogy and chemistry are essential for pollution assessment and evaluation.
Sediments usually contain large amounts of fine grained clay minerals, which are known to transport pollutants by adsorption, and/or complex exchange at the clay–water interface.
Hydrocarbon accumulations are known to be sediment dependents and the levels of contamination can be visualized using the SOM component planes (c-planes).
The SOM component planes of the input variables for the samples are illustrated in Figs.
5–11.
The self-organizing map of each variable corresponds as presented in the figures to the map of the sample locations in Fig 2.
Each hexagonal unit on the map found at a particular location on the different component planes has the same location on the unit map.
The values of the different components are represented using different colors with the scale on the right of each component map.

The unified distance matix (U-matrix) as presented in the SOM output provides the visualization of the relative distances between the neurons.
Color differential is effectively used to show the calculated distance differences between adjacent neurons.
A lighter color on the u-matrix indicates the closeness of the vectors in the input space while darker colors represent larger distances between vector values in the input space.
The u-matrix also helps to identify clusters in the datasets.
The SOM procedure using the u-matrix provides faster knowledge based interpretation of the input dataset distributions.
SOM sediment interpretation The SOM map sizes were selected by considering the map quality using the three normalization methods (“log”, “var”, “range”) by choosing the map size with the lowest TE and QE value.
Table 2 shows the summary of the different map size considered for the different samples, the optimum size was selected for each sampling materials based on minimized values for TE and QE.
For the analysis of the sediment samples in the study area, the log normalization gave the best map quality with a 60-uint map size (i.e.
10 × 6) and with TE = 0, QE = 0.84 (Table 5).
The number of neurons (n = 60) are also close to the number of samples (n = 54).
The topology of the input data was perfectly preserved with TE = 0 which is vital (Kohonen, 2001).
The component planes (c-planes) of the 9 input variables are represented in Fig 2 the visualization of the clusters were conspicuous making the interpretation easier.
The c-planes of the input variables for the sediment as shown in Fig 5 classified the different variables and due to the minimal effects of gas flaring in the areas on sediment chemical composition, low values of pH, NO3 and PO4 were recorded in the sampled area.
There are increases in the area of contaminations with high pollutant volumes and especially hydrocarbon concentration.
Towards the South Western (SW) parts of the study areas (Fig 5), sediment contaminations were determined to be minimal as opposed to the northern areas with high concentrations of TPHs, PAHs and BTEX.
PAHs and BTEX concentrations were observed to be spatially identical suggesting the possibility of a common source of contaminations in the area, the maximum values of PAHs and BTEX distribution in the sediments were at western points marked by extensive petrochemical activities, and these values decrease towards the South Eastern (SE) areas but increase in the opposite direction to all other parts.
The TPHs concentrations are higher for the northern portion of the map with moderate to low values around the center.
This phenomenon suggests that some level of remedial actions have been carried out in some residential areas in this region with high human population.

Soil SOM interpretation The analysis of the soil samples in the study with organic pollutant variables was also presented to the SOM.
For the soil and the ‘log’ normalization identified the best map quality with a 100-uint map size (i.e.
20 × 5) and with TE = 0.031, QE = 0.002 (Table 3) for the , and a 125-unit map size (i.e.
25 × 5) with TE = 0.000, QE = 0.668 (Table 4) for .
While for the soil the ‘range’ normalization gave the best map quality with a 100-uint map size (i.e.
20 × 5), TE = 0.000, QE = 0.136 (Table 5).
The number of neurons (n = 100) are comparatively close to the number of samples (n = 98).
Visualization of the c-planes for the soil was helpful in the interpretation of the datasets as shown in Fig 6.
The soil showed similar distribution trends in the entire area for the individual carcinogenic PAHs.
Elevated values of representing high molecular weight (HMW) PAHs which are usually adsorbed on particles or present in oil droplets were found to be present in soils in the entire area except for the upper North Western (NW) part which showed lower values which could be potentially due to long proximity to the pollution sources closer to the southern parts on the study map.
The distribution of soil suggest abundance of Nap, 2Mnap, Ace, Phen and Pyr trending SW of the study area while higher values of Flu, Ant, Flr and BghiP are confined towards the SE as shown in Fig 4.
Fig 5 illustrates the distribution of soil and the displayed patterns were observed.
Majority of the PAHs in the environment were confined to the south due to the heavy influence of petrochemical industrial activities as the primary source of the pollutants.
High values of lower molecular weight (LMW) PAHs (Nap, 2MNap, Ace, Pyr, and Acy), as well as non-cancer inducing PAHs were confined to the SW areas of the study region.
Alternatively, the HMW PAHs and carcinogenic PAHs (BaP, DahA, InP, Chr, BbF and BkF) were more prominent in high concentrations in the SE regions.
Mainstream petrochemical activities are situated in the southern parts of the areas under study.
Human settlements are also present in these heavily contaminated areas putting the health of residents at a higher risk.

The minimal error was achieved using the ‘range’ normalization giving a map size of 10 × 4 (40 neurons) and TE = 0.000, QE = 0.562 (Table 6).
The c-planes for the 14 input variables are shown in Fig 6.
As seen with the PAHs distributions in the study area, elevated concentrations of heavy metals in soils are also higher in the southern parts as can be easily visualized in Fig 6.
The c-planes show the levels and concentrations of these substances in the study area.
As shown on the c-planes, these areas are characterized by high levels of the metals Mn, Ni, Fe and especially Pb, Cr, Zn, Cd and Cu (Fig 6) are higher towards the northern part of the study area.
This can be attributed to the extensive metallurgical processes involved in petroleum exploration such as pipeline laying, welding activities, excavations and also the heavy metal content in crude oil as a result of transportation potentials of the petrochemicals and oil spills which are predominant in this region.
Carcinogenic heavy metals include Pb, Ni, Cd and Cr, these metals are contained in high values in the entire central and southern areas.
Some of the metals when present in background levels are not considered toxic, but occurrence of these elements in elevated levels can be potentially deleterious to human health and the environment due to the enrichment of these metals.

Water SOM interpretation Input data from water samples with heavy metal variables were analyzed and classified with the SOM, a 15 unit map size (5 × 3) was selected with TE = 0.000, QE = 0.756 (Table 7), while the for water samples were also analyzed using the SOM algorithm with an optimized map size of 15 units (5 × 3) and TE = 0.000, QE = 0.418 (Table 8).
The c-planes for the 14 input variables water metal and 18 variables for the PAHs are shown in Figs.
10 and 11 respectively.
A decreasing trend of water conductivity was observed from the south towards the northern part of the map as shown in Fig 10.
Also, the enrichment of Cr, Zn, Cd and Ni were observed in the northern part on the map.
Using the unified matrix (u-matrix), the general trend of heavy metal contamination in water were towards the western part on the map except for Pb, Mn, Cu and fe that showed considerable water contamination towards the south.
The high heavy metal values in both the surface and ground water determined in this study suggest that the human populations that regularly rely on these water sources for sustenance and survival are potentially at risk of adverse health effects.

The water then contains these pollutants in droplet or in dissolved phases.
Due to the low solubility of aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds, they are usually present in water in the dissolved phase while aromatic hydrocarbons such as the PAHs are found in either of the phases depending on the molecular weight (MW) of the organic compound.
BTEX are LMW aromatics and are moderately soluble in the water phase together with Nap.
The HMW PAHs are mostly in the dispersed phase (OGP, 2005).
The anomalous trends displayed in the SOM c-planes by water PAHs in the study areas as shown in Fig 11, suggest possible oil contamination which could possibly have resulted from oil spills, deck wash, sabotaged pipelines and transportation related emissions.
These trends also correlate with the pollutant concentrations and distributions in the sediment and soil samples with highest values at the southern part of the map and the concentration gradient is steep within these areas.
BaP is the most toxic carcinogenic PAHs; it is contained in relatively higher levels throughout the southern parts posing significant carcinogenic risks to the residents of these areas.
Soil SOM interpretation for the individual sites Analyses of soil PAHs for each of the sampled sites were also carried out using the input data for soil presented to the SOM.
The map unit sizes for the four locations are; BN {= 6 × 4; 24 units; using ‘range’ normalization, TE = 0.040, QE = 0.077 (Table 9)}, ER {= 5 × 4; 20 units; using ‘range’ normalization, TE = 0.000, QE = 0.151 (Table 10)}, OD {= 7 × 4; 28 units; using ‘log’ normalization, TE = 0.000, QE = 0.637 (Table 11)}, OG {= 8 × 4; 32 units; using ‘log’ normalization, TE = 0.000, QE = 0.674 (Table 12)}.
The datasets were trained for individual sample locations as to have a detailed understanding of the local trend in the datasets.
As presented in Fig 12, the BN location is characterized by high values of soil which corresponds to the location of the crude oil terminals towards the southern parts of the sampled area.
The trend displayed by the soil at BN location (Fig 12) indicates decreasing concentrations from pollutant source from the SE towards every other direction on the map.
This trend is consistent with the combined soil carcinogenic PAHs analyses for all location presented in Fig 6.
While for the ER location, the SOM visualization using the c-planes presented in Fig 13 shows expected trends as majority of the petrochemical industries in the ER area are located between the center and towards the southern regions.
The were distributed from the center towards the south of the map and these high values of in the soil of the area are imminent treats to the health and safety of the residents.
The OD location is largely characterized by oil spills and waste discharges from petrochemical activities.
The show pattern of higher contaminations towards the south as shown in Fig 14 which is consistent with other datasets analyzed.
BaP, BkF and InP were determined to have the highest concentration values in the area which suggest that the risk of cancer induction for residents in this area especially those living in the southern parts is potentially high.
This trend is identical to the trend observed from the OG SOM visualization as shown in Fig 15.
The major difference is that for the OG location, the c-plane for the total (Fig 15) showed uncontaminated areas on the North East (NE) area of the map against the North West (NW) uncontaminated sites established at the OD location.

The physico-chemical properties (pH, TPH, BTEX, PAH, COD, SO4, PO4, NO3, and heavy metals) in the recipient environment of Bonny, Eriemu, Odidi and Ughelli (Warri) were assessed in sediments, soils and water.
The SOM was used as a powerful visualization tool to identify trends in the dataset.
Areas with high concentrations of pollutants were easily identified from the c-planes which revealed vital information for the interpretation of the results.
Preliminary diagnosis of the quality of locational sediment, soil and water can be effectively carried out using the SOM algorithm to develop the c-planes.
The physical, ecotoxicological and chemical features embedded in the datasets common to different locations sampled were easy to identify using the SOM c-planes and the most prevalent contaminants were identified for the different locations which would aid in remedial planning and decision making.
From the result of the SOM dataset processing, it was observed that majority of the sites were contaminated with carcinogenic PAHs and carcinogenic heavy metals which are of concern due to the effects on human health.
Comprehensive remediation and mitigation plans are recommended for these areas.
Furthermore, the provision of effective health care facilities that can evaluate the health conditions of the residents in the high contamination zones identified by the SOM and the provision of urgent care needed to those severely affected by the chronic exposure to these pollutants are also recommended.
Therefore, these stations from the Niger Delta should be classified as highest priority sites regarding heavy metals and PAHs carcinogenic pollution when considering remediation decisions.
