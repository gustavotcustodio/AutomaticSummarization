0.071677 - Nutrition Care Process Model (NCPM) During nutrition diagnosis phase, a dietitian would identify and label the patient which indicates an occurrence, risk, or potential of developing some kind of nutritional issues that dietitians should treat.
0.096275 - From the data gathering in the previous step, nutrition assessment, dietitians would organize and analyze the data and reveal diagnostic category and finally comes up with appropriate nutrition diagnosis.
0.043406 - A nutrition diagnosis is different from a medical diagnosis which could be defined as a disease or some type of pathological disorder of a particular organ that can be treated.
0.044968 - A nutrition diagnosis would change when patient’s response changes.
0.056980 - A medical diagnosis does not change as long as the disease condition stays.

0.050854 - A nutrition diagnosis contains three major components.
0.022039 - They are problem (diagnostic label), etiology (cause/contributing factors) and signs/symptoms (defining characteristics).
0.043573 - A diagnostic label is a phrase or sentence which describes the patient’s condition such as increased/decreased, or having risk of.
0.066007 - In etiology, we state the cause of the problem.
0.051282 - This helps in determining whether or not we should be expecting that the following nutritional intervention would effectively help the patient with his/her nutritional condition.
0.063260 - By recording the etiology, we may also gain the benefit of identifying the cause and thus correct it.
0.118368 - In the signs and symptom components of the nutritional diagnosis, we record both subjective and objective signs and symptoms for the patient.
0.085106 - The signs and symptoms component includes patient’s biochemical data, anthropometric measurements, physical examination findings and food/nutrition history.
0.098191 - These data allows quantifying the problem and permit us to evaluate and give a severity ranking.
0.039456 - The symptoms are changes the patient verbally tells the dietitians while the signs are observable fluctuations in the patient’s health status.
0.100892 - The nutrition diagnosis should be prepared in PES format, which stands for problem/etiology/signs and symptoms.
0.071625 - According to American Dietetic Association, a well-written nutrition diagnostic statement should be: 1.

0.031373 - Consult evidence based practice guides.
0.074906 - Determine expected outcome for the patient.
0.071625 - This should be obvious and brief and expressed in a recognizable and measureable way.
0.075601 - This should be evaluated based on the patient.
0.089835 - The intervention should be focused on the cause (etiology) and should be effective based on latest knowledge and evidence.
0.085470 - Determine time and frequency of the intervention, including strength, period and follow-ups.

0.000000 - Step 4.
0.049383 - Nutrition monitoring and evaluation.
0.114790 - Monitoring refers to the measurement and review of a patient’s status at a pre-defined interval with regards to the nutrition diagnosis, intervention and outcomes.
0.051680 - Evaluation is the organized comparison of patient’s current status versus patient’s previous nutritional status.
0.090926 - Dietetics professionals could find out the recommended times for follow ups in American Dietetic Professional’s Evidence-Based Guides for Practice and other evidence based sources.
0.098139 - The goal of nutrition monitoring and evaluation is to determine the progress of each intervention and to find out whether the desired nutritional status has been achieved by adopting the selected nutritional interventions.
0.056980 - The progress should be recorded on a schedule until the patient is discharged.
0.100744 - There are three steps in the process of nutritional monitoring and evaluation.
0.000000 - Monitor progress.

0.095948 - According to American Dietetic Association (ADA)’s definition, Nutrition diagnosis is a dietetics professional’s recognition and naming of an existing nutritional problem of a patient which the dietetic professional is responsible for treating (Bueche, 2008a).
0.057667 - Currently, nutrition diagnosis is not included in dietetics’ daily workflow.
0.119341 - Dietetics professionals currently rely on medical diagnosis made by physicians as the major reference in the nutritional assessment work.
0.120495 - Dietetics professionals then design the nutritional treatment plan according to the medical diagnosis.
0.075396 - During nutritional assessment, dietetics professionals create raw data by record their findings on a chart.
0.041344 - They would gather patient’s biochemical data, anthropometric data, physical exam findings, and food/nutrition histories.
0.047198 - This would generate a huge amount of raw data for a patient.
0.097176 - After gathering all those data, a dietetics professional will have to write a statement stating what problem has been found or solved for the patient.
0.088544 - At present, there exists no standard terminology for dietetics professional to record their findings.
0.075188 - This leads to the communication issues among dietetics due to the lack of standard terminology (Peng, 2005).
0.077859 - This has prompted American Dietetic Association to establish Nutrition Care Process Model (NCPM) in 2003 (Lacey & Pritchett, 2003).
0.083272 - Since the nutritional diagnosis step’s main purpose is to give a diagnostic label to the patient, if a nutritional diagnostic label could not be determined by the dietetics professional, the patient might be referred back to the primary provider (see Fig 2-1).

0.100565 - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States has launched a web based system called “The National Outbreak Reporting System” in 2009, which was designed to improve quality, quantity and availability of data for not only food borne but also for water borne, person-to-person as well as animal-to-person disease outbreaks in the states (Sobel, Khan, & Swerdlow, 2002).
0.103493 - Hoggle defined nutrition informatics as “the specialty in the field of human nutrition and dietetics that integrates science, evidence-based practice, research, computer knowledge, and expertise in electronic information systems for the purpose of supporting optimal nutritional status and health” (Hoggle, Michael, Houston, & Ayres, 2006).
0.082883 - In order to effectively utilize the benefit of ADA’s NCPM, a standard terminology is required to communicate, document, and evaluate the effectiveness of nutrition care (Hakel-Smith & Lewis, 2004).
0.057803 - The medical profession developed the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) so that physicians could describe a patient’s medical condition with standardized terms and thus reduce confusion.
0.091586 - A standard, International Dietetics and Nutrition Terminology (IDNT) is being developed by ADA.
0.122726 - IDNT will allow dietetics to describe with a standardized terminology for nutritional assessment, nutritional diagnosis, nutrition intervention, and nutrition monitoring and evaluation.
0.068729 - NCPM and INDT are complementary to each other.
0.074534 - NCPM provides a standard process to solve the problem while INDT provided the standard term to describe the results of the model (Bueche, 2008b).
0.051317 - For nutritional informatics, INDT will play a very important role.
0.036697 - A standard terminology provides exact data entry, management, retrieval, and correlation.

0.115609 - Its rule base consists of 450 rules and one thousand facts of medicine regarding to meningitis infections.
0.133989 - The system was successful and it proved that with a rather simple representation of rules in a form of if-then-else statements is enough to handle with a rather complicated but focused domain area such as meningitis infection diagnosis.
0.087855 - However, due to some political issues, MYCIN was never put to use in a clinical setting.
0.094395 - It was only used for learning and training purposes (Buchanan & Duda, 1982).
0.133870 - It is after the successful development of MYCIN, the expert system technology began to see a light of being commercialized.

0.080190 - Mature (after 1990) After 1990, expert systems are used in many different areas.
0.084176 - According to Buchanan and Smith (2003), the definition of an expert system is: “An expert system is an interactive computer-based decision tool that uses both facts and heuristics to solve difficult decision problems based on knowledge acquired from an expert.” An expert system is a software program which helps solving the problems with expert-level solutions and is heuristic, transparent and flexible.
0.074450 - It reasons with human experts’ domain knowledge while providing explanations of how it reaches the conclusion and is flexible so that it can easily add or update its existing knowledge (Buchanan & Smith, 2003).
0.097284 - Expert system is a branch of applied artificial intelligence developed in mid 60.
0.128365 - The principle behind an expert system is basically transferring the expertise from human to computer.
0.123031 - Expert systems could aid non-experts to perform better instead of replacing the experts entirely.
0.135317 - One of the purposes of expert systems is to make expert’s knowledge and experience more widely available (Efraim Turban & Aronson, 2001).
0.081202 - Expertise from human would be stored in a database and when the knowledge is needed, users or programs could easily retrieve the knowledge stored in the database when needed.
0.160170 - The expert system should be able to make inferences and comes to a conclusion.
0.107231 - Much like a human expert, the expert system should have the capability to explain the logic that it uses in order to come up with a conclusion (Efraim Turban and Aronson, 2001).
0.090119 - Architecture of an expert system The basic architecture of an expert system comprises of four modules (Wang, 1994): 1.
0.085470 - Working memory – To temperately store the data and the facts during program execution.
0.139761 - Inference Engine – To execute rules which reside in the rule base with forward chaining capability.

0.106195 - Explanation Facility – The ability to trace rules used to reach the conclusions.
0.103359 - Knowledge Acquisition Facility – The user interface used by knowledge engineers to convert expert knowledge into rules.
0.149403 - It also allows adding, editing and deletion of rules in the knowledge base.
0.129882 - The development of functional expert systems is always centered on the organization of a knowledge base.
0.104460 - Fig 2-2 shows the typical integration of expert systems components.
0.114288 - Knowledge engineers collects and organizes knowledge gathered from domain expert then convert the expert knowledge into a form which computer expert system understands and save those converted knowledge into the knowledge base.
0.096820 - Users enter the collected facts into the system via the user interface and save the data into the fact base.
0.104460 - Finally, users get the results, recommendations and explanations from the system.
0.089965 - Integration of expert systems components Fig 2-2.
0.102776 - Integration of expert systems components.
0.068980 - As we can tell from Fig 2-2, an expert system communicates with the end users through the user interface while gathers the knowledge it required through a knowledge acquisition interface which is used by knowledge engineers.
0.108202 - Therefore, the expert system has two features.
0.110613 - Frequent user interactions: An expert system collects data from the users and formulates the end results based on these data.
0.122680 - Independent and dynamic knowledge base: The major difference of an expert system from a traditional program is that the knowledge is independent from the program flow.
0.080521 - Knowledge engineers could create, modify or delete the content of the knowledge base as the knowledge evolves.
0.110193 - Knowledge contents could be updated without the need to recompile and redeploy the application.
0.152379 - The knowledge base contains the problem-solving rules that was gathered and converted from human experts in a given problem domain.
0.105463 - The representation of knowledge in a knowledge base is usually in the following form.
0.053068 - IF <conditions> THEN <action list> ELSE <action list> Conditions are expressions involving attributes, in our case; it contains the patient’s biochemical data, anthropometric measurements, physical exam findings, food/nutrition history, and diseases/conditions.
0.071625 - An action list consists of a single function in our system, which is AddDiagnosis().
0.091744 - Thus, a full example of a rule might be similar to the following: IF this.BMI < 18.5 THEN this.AddDiagnosis(“Underweight”).
0.109031 - It is the knowledge engineer’s job to translate the knowledge gathered from domain experts to the knowledge base.
0.132672 - The inference engine is responsible for searching applicable rules from the knowledge base to apply to a certain problem.
0.123396 - In recent years, the proliferation of World Wide Web has enabled web-based expert systems.
0.096461 - Web-based expert systems have been proposed in several knowledge domains such as fish disease diagnosis (Li, Fu, & Duan, 2002), pig disease diagnosis (Zetian, Feng, Yun, & XiaoShuan, 2005), and nutrition advising (Huse & Shyne, 1992).
0.115202 - The application area of expert systems The major application areas for expert systems include but not limited to the following (Shu-Hsien, 2005): Interpretation, Prediction, Diagnosis, Planning, Design, Monitoring, Debugging, Instruction, and control.

0.049383 - Determine the problem area.
0.110613 - One of the features of an expert system is that it is designed to solve issues of a specific area.
0.114085 - Therefore first step of developing an expert system is to establish the problem area and reduce the scope to a level where the system is capable to handle and provides reasonable performance during program execution.
0.074074 - Gathering of the knowledge.
0.156590 - Expert Systems require containing the knowledge from expert for a specific problem domain in order to make inference and decisions.
0.033058 - This is often done by gathering data from literatures or interviewing several domain experts.
0.062745 - .Determining the knowledge presentation form.
0.118539 - After collecting and organizing expert knowledge, knowledge engineers must find a method to convert the gathered knowledge into a form which the computer expert system understands.
0.145361 - The major forms to represent expert knowledge in expert systems are rule-based system, frame-based system, semantic networks, neural networks and predicate logic.
0.017316 - Selection of platform.
0.139877 - We need to choose a platform (operating system) for which the expert system will be running.
0.017316 - Selection of language.
0.035398 - We need to determine which programming language that we want to use.
0.070588 - Selection of the inference engine.
0.090926 - In order to actually begin building a knowledge base, we have to select an inference engine according to our decision with regards to the knowledge presentation.
0.066746 - Creation of knowledge base.
0.105533 - After the completion of organizing and analyzing expert knowledge, knowledge engineers will use the knowledge acquisition interface to build the knowledge base by converting expert knowledge into a form which computer expert system understands and simulate every possible user inputs to the system to test if the knowledge base is working as it is designed.
0.091324 - System tests.
0.133278 - After the completion of the expert system, we need to evaluate the system’s correctness with real world cases and adjust the knowledge base if the results are unsatisfactory.
0.067061 - History of web development To appreciate the distinct characteristics of ASP.NET MVC, it is helpful to understand a little history of web development so far.
0.026403 - Since this research is based on Microsoft’s technologies.
0.011019 - I will only focus on Microsoft’s web development history (see Table 2-1).
0.000000 - Table 2-1.
0.066007 - Lists the history of Microsoft’s web development technologies.
0.034597 - Period Technology Strengths Weakness 1993 Common Gateway Interface (CGI) Simple, flexible, only option at the time Runs outside of the web server, resource intensive, low level 1996 Microsoft Internet Database Connector Runs inside a web server Simply a wrapper for SQL queries and templates for the result 1996 Active Server Pages (ASP) General-purpose Interpreted at run-time, encourages spaghetti code 2002 ASP 1.0/1.1 Compiled “stateful” UI Heavy on bandwidth, ugly HTML, untestable 2005 ASP.NET 2.0 Vast infrastructure 2007 ASP.NET AJAX Encourages object oriented programming 2008 ASP.NET 3.5 ASP.NET was a huge step in progress when Microsoft first released it back in 2005.
0.080216 - It not only provided developers with a brand new multi-language managed code platform but also tried to make the developer’s experience to be similar for developing a stateful, object oriented windows form program and a stateless HTML based web development.
0.096552 - Microsoft tried to hide both HTTP and HTML by modeling the UI as a series of server side control objects.
0.021164 - Each control keeps its own state across requests, automatically renders HTML when required and automatically wires client side events such as button click with a corresponding server side event handler codes.
0.025397 - In reality, a webform is simply a gigantic abstraction layer.
0.023641 - ASP.NET MVC ASP.NET MVC framework is a model–view–controller pattern web application framework created by Microsoft.
0.037333 - An ASP.NET MVC application is composed of three basic modules: model, view and controller.
0.059406 - The model is the core information of the application.
0.085213 - It contains the objects that reflect the real world objects and is often connected to a database.
0.048930 - The view is the presentation layer (user interface) of the application.
0.061162 - In ASP.NET MVC, the view is composed of HTML codes.
0.052805 - The controller contains the business logic of the application.
0.101333 - It sits between the view and the model to control the execution of the application.
0.057348 - The weakness of the traditional ASP.NET.
0.063116 - ViewState The behind the scene mechanism that maintains states across requests often results in large amount of data being transferred between the server and the client.
0.044657 - It could easily reach hundreds of kilobytes in many real world applications and it is designed so that it travels back and forth with each web requests and resulting in slow websites or web-based applications.
0.074314 - Page life cycle This is the mechanism to keep server side event handler to be in sync with the client side actions.
0.074074 - This mechanism often gets complicated and resulting hard to debug issues such as when some of the event handlers won’t execute.
0.021333 - Managing run time control hierarchy of server controls is always a .NET programmer’s nightmare.
0.000000 - Limited control over HTML Server controls render as themselves as HTML.
0.046512 - Often the generated HTML does not comply with web standards or take good advantage of CSS.
0.064646 - The worst part is that it generates unpredictable and complex ID values, thus making it hard if not impossible to call with custom JavaScript codes.
0.082759 - False sense of separation of concerns The code-behind concept makes it possible to separate HTML from the application code.
0.105976 - This was thought to be the way to separate logic and presentation, however, in reality with this code-behind model, developers are encouraged to mix their presentation code with logic code.
0.067183 - Untestable The architecture of web form based design is not designed with unit test in mind.
0.014337 - It is totally incompatible with automated tests.
0.015686 - Benefits of ASP.NET MVC
0.068127 - ASP.NET MVC provides a much better separation of concerns by adopting the MVC (model–view–controller) architecture.
0.014337 - MVC architecture is not a new concept.
0.076696 - It dates back to 1978 from the Smalltalk project at Xerox PARC.
0.064368 - Web applications integrate several different technologies and often divide into a set of tiers which maps to MVC architecture naturally.
0.067114 - MVC framework was built as a series of independent components, by implementing an interface or built on an abstract base class.
0.097324 - Therefore a programmer is able to easily replace the routing system, the view engine, or any framework components.
0.076190 - ASP.NET MVC was designed with automated test in mind.
0.097625 - With it, we can now write testing codes for each of the controller and action in the application.
0.031373 - Making our program more maintainable.
0.071563 - While the build in HTML helper produce XHTML compliant output, the framework encourages programmers to write simple HTML codes for UI components and style the UI with CSS.
0.068687 - ASP.NET MVC pages do not contain any ViewState data, therefore it allows us to save the bandwidth and maximize the speed of our application.
0.077135 - With the ASP.NET MVC, it became easy for programmers to create neat URLs.
0.050575 - For example, we were used to see cryptic URLs such as /app/default.asp?u=1&book=9&action=2.
0.036697 - When using the neat URL, we might have /User/buy/book9.
0.026403 - There are many benefits of using a neat URL.
0.068966 - First, we can hide the technical details, folder and filename structures from the public, thus making our application more secure.
0.066007 - Second, the neat URL is more search engine friendly.
0.048110 - Third, users are more likely to remember it.
0.093857 - Microsoft’s .NET Framework provides a mature, production suite of components and facilities that can be used in the project to save both development efforts and time and increase productivity.
0.086957 - Since ASP.NET MVC is based on .NET Framework 3.5, we are able to utilize the extensive set of APIs, components and facilities.
0.046512 - ASP.NET MVC is designed with the new features of .NET 3.5 languages in mind.
0.000000 - Therefore, it works very well with these new features.
0.065294 - The most important recent feature in the advancement of .NET language is the invention of Language Integrated Query (LINQ) LINQ saves programmers many efforts in creating mechanisms to cope with the difference between object oriented programming language and relational database.
0.056645 - Object oriented programming The notion of object oriented programming is to use computer objects to construct an abstraction of real world objects.
0.066506 - An object has properties and method just like the objects in the real world.
0.053333 - Object oriented programming is a packaging method that facilitates the creation of meaningful software units.
0.000000 - Those units are focused on specific problem areas.
0.014981 - Classes represent groups of related objects.
0.091954 - For example, apples and oranges belongs to “Fruit” class, even though they are different in color, taste, size, and textures.
0.080537 - A class specifies the general format of its objects; the properties and actions available to an object depend on its class.
0.053548 - One of the major benefit of writing programs with an object oriented approach is it allows us to reuse the code that we wrote, which would save programmers a lot of time for re-inventing the wheels as well as saving time in maintaining the program.
0.044077 - Programming techniques for object oriented programming includes data abstraction, encapsulation, modularity, polymorphism, and inheritance.
0.000000 - Most major programming languages today are object oriented programming languages.
0.120622 - Introduction to C# language C# Programming language, developed by Microsoft was designed specifically for the .NET platform.
0.072607 - C# has the roots in C, C++ and Java.
0.068376 - Adapting the best features of each and adding new features of its own.
0.052288 - C# is an event driven, object oriented, visual programming language for which the programs are created using an integrated development environment (IDE).
0.081112 - The programmers can create, run, test and debug C# programs conveniently within the IDE which saves a lot of precious time and increase the productivity of programmers.
0.070175 - The process of creating programs rapidly using an IDE is referred to as Rapid Application Development (RAD).
0.058667 - .NET Framework and the common language runtime The .NET Framework is the core of .NET.
0.044743 - This framework manages and executes applications, contains a class library (Framework Class Library), enforces security and provides many other programming capabilities.
0.086981 - The details of the .NET Framework are found in the Common Language Specification (CLS), which includes information regarding to the storage of objects and other information.
0.085470 - Microsoft has submitted CLS for standardization to ECMA (the European Computer Manufacturers Association).
0.077135 - This allows the independent software companies to create the .NET Framework for other platforms.
0.045584 - The common language runtime (CLR) is another central part of the .NET Framework.
0.000000 - It executes C# codes.
0.012698 - Programs are compiled into machine specific instructions in two steps.
0.038095 - First, the program is compiled into Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL).
0.074906 - MSIL defines instructions for the CLR.
0.060471 - After that, another compiler in the CLR compiles the MSIL into machine code, creating a single application.
0.082840 - The reasons for this two step compiling scheme are portability among operating systems, interoperability among languages and execution management features such as memory management and security.
0.036176 - If the .NET Framework is installed on a platform, that platform can run any .Net programs.
0.058997 - The ability to run on different platform is known as platform independence.
0.012232 - Code written once can be used on another machine without modification.
0.022039 - .NET Framework also provides a feature which enables a high level of language interoperability.
0.044444 - Programs written in different languages are all compiled to MSIL.
0.066478 - MSIL allows the .Net Framework to be language independent since MSIL is not tied to a particular programming language.
0.022039 - Any language that can be compiled into MSIL is called a .NET compliant language.
0.021333 - .NET Framework also provides several reusable classes which can be accessed by any .NET language.
0.051183 - ADO.NET Entity Framework According to Microsoft, Entity Framework is not intended to be a replacement of current ADO.NET data access technologies.
0.051680 - Instead, it is an enhancement to ADO.NET, giving developers a better approach to accessing data.
0.086629 - Allowing developers to work with conceptual model, and therefore enable developers to deal with data as objects and properties, which is the basic concept of object oriented programming.
0.041344 - ASP.NET MVC framework does not restrict or regulate the methods we persist our domain model.
0.053528 - Here we are facing an issue that most of the developers would face in most object orientated programming.
0.043818 - The “object-relational impedance mismatch”, it is encountered whenever we are trying to use the relational database as the storage solution when writing with an object-oriented programming language such as the one we are using – C#.
0.041298 - There exists many methods for application modeling, each has a different focus.
0.076190 - The following lists some of the approaches and their focus.
0.063694 - ERM (Entity Relationship Model): Used with databases, it is a way to represent logical relationships of objects in order to create a database.
0.055096 - UML (Unified Modeling Language): A standard modeling language which is used to describe objects.
0.056980 - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping): Method for mapping object-oriented programming and relational databases.
0.093023 - DFD (Data Flow Diagram): A graphical representation of the flow of data between processes and systems.
0.066478 - There are other products in the marketplace which provides similar functionalities to Entity Framework, such as the following: 1.
0.089835 - NHibernate: This is an open source project which was ported from Hibernate Core for Java for the .NET Framework.
0.085470 - It allows persisting plain .NET Objects to and from a backend relational database.
0.022039 - Spring.net: An open source application framework which is based on JAVA Spring framework.
0.062016 - The abundance of these products showed that there is a need for a good ERM application.
0.058932 - The Entity Framework (EF) is an object persistent layer that includes object/relational mapping (O/RM) tool to replace an object graph diagram for the traditional relational database schema.
0.071146 - The responsibility of a persistent layer are to instantiate a desired set of object instances in memory together with a representation of their associations and able to save the in-memory changes to objects and to their property values to rows and columns of a relational database.
0.085154 - The Entity Framework is a set of Microsoft technologies which helps fill in the space between object oriented programming model and relational databases.
0.000000 - This is commonly known as “impedance mismatch”.
0.076063 - It exists due to the fact the mapping and organization of classes does not match with the organization of relational objects.
0.068027 - Developers used to have to write huge amounts of codes just to persist the data to the database, with the help of Entity Framework; developers can save a lot of time and effort and focus the attention on developing the core function of the program.
0.166459 - WF rule-engine The major part of an expert system is the rule-engine.
0.106644 - There’re many open source and commercial rule engines available to use.
0.113771 - For this research, I have chosen to use the rule-engine that comes with every installation of .NET framework 3.5 SP1.
0.145400 - I used the rule engine capability contained within Windows Workflow Foundation outside of a workflow, and leverage it to act as the main inference engine for the nutritional diagnosis expert system.
0.100945 - Windows Workflow Foundation (WF) that came with .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 includes a free and powerful rule engine, allowing the Workflow developer to logically divide the application’s business rules from the Workflow Assemblies.
0.088632 - Rules enabled programmers to represent and implement the business requirements of the application into a set of declarative statements, which can be imposed at runtime (Willis, 2006).
0.052805 - Each rule is composed of three separate parts: 1.
0.013201 - An If conditional statement which returns a Boolean value.
0.047198 - A Then statement that is executed if the “if” condition returns true.
0.034188 - An optional else statement which is executed when the “if” condition returns false.
0.009456 - Collectively, these three parts form an if-then-else construct that works like C#’s if-then-else statement.
0.100458 - A rule is executed by evaluating the condition and then executing one of the actions depending on the result from the condition.
0.022039 - Each action could contain one or more C# statements that are executed in sequence.
0.099564 - During the rule set execution, each rule is fired, and the appropriate actions performed.
0.088162 - There are several ways that we can control the sequence in which the rules in a rule set are evaluated.
0.108869 - The default is that the rules are fired in alphabetical order based on the rule name.
0.074074 - We could change the default ordering by modifying the priority of our rules.
0.099788 - Those rules with higher priority will be evaluated first, when both rules has the same priority, the system will determine the ordering by alphabetical order of the rule names.
0.118368 - The rule engine has a feature called forward chaining, what it means is that the system will automatically re-evaluate the rules.
0.086022 - It monitors the dependency of each rules.
0.060812 - If a rule changes a variable that is referenced in a condition of a previously evaluated rule, forward chaining would fire that rule again automatically.
0.112544 - Originally, Microsoft designed the WF Rules to be used with WF programs.
0.125911 - However, in our Nutritional Diagnosis Expert System, we do not intent to implement with WF program; instead we only intended to utilize the rule engine that came with WF.
0.095559 - For the purpose of our program, we have three expectations for the use of this rule engine.
0.065600 - We need a way to externalize a rule set, so that we do not need to call it within a WF program.
0.072993 - We will need to figure out how to apply a set of rules to ASP.NET MVC programs.
0.125870 - We will need the rules to be stored in a database and to have a program which allows IT personnel to create or update rules.
0.112037 - Typically, in a WF program, Rules are defined in the Workflow are serialized to a .rules XML file which is compiled and became an embedded resource for the Workflow assembly.
0.091586 - At the run-time, the .rules resource is then de-serialized and evaluated.
0.072096 - While this method is fine with some types of application, it does not fit our Nutritional Diagnosis Expert System’s requirement.
0.105584 - We do not want to recompile and re-deploy our application every time the rules are modified.
0.103095 - MVC architecture The nutritional diagnosis expert system has adopted Microsoft’s ASP.NET MVC as its development framework.
0.055138 - ASP.NET MVC offers a much improved separation of concern than traditional WebForm based web development framework.
0.076433 - The MVC pattern is not a new concept; it was first implemented by Trygve Reenskaug in Xerox PARC back in 1978 (Reenskaug, 1978).
0.097176 - The fundamental idea of MVC is to bridge the gap between the human’s mental model and the digital model that exists in the computer.
0.042463 - The ideal MVC solution is the one in which the developers feels like they are directly manipulating the real world object (Shan, 1989).
0.089172 - The structure is useful if the developer needs to see the same model element simultaneously in different contexts and/or from different viewpoints.
0.063954 - From Google Trends, I used the keyword, “MVC web” and “webform” to analyze the search trends for these 2 web development technology and found out that the search for the keyword “MVC web” has increased its popularity steadily and continue to do so for now while the search for the keyword “webform” is on the declining curve since the peak in 2004.
0.052434 - The results are presented in Figs.
0.031373 - 3-1 and 3-2.
0.026403 - Google trends result for “MVC web” Fig 3-1.
0.029963 - Google trends result for “MVC web”.
0.027491 - Google trends result for “Webform” Fig 3-2.
0.031373 - Google trends result for “Webform”.
0.024465 - MVC architecture is gaining popularity today especially in web development area.
0.038095 - The reasons maybe the following (see Fig 3-3): 1.
0.025397 - User interaction with MVC application is suitable for web applications.
0.108932 - Usually a user takes an action and the application changes the data model and then displays an updated view to the user.
0.047198 - This similarity makes MVC a fit for web applications we use today.
0.011019 - Web applications today combines several different technologies including databases, HTML, JavaScript, binary codes, etc.
0.058166 - In order to simply the complexity, a web application is usually split into tiers or layers, this pattern resembles MVC pattern.
0.051680 - ASP.NET MVC implements a modern deviation of MVC which is specifically designed to web applications.
0.000000 - MVC architecture Fig 3-3.
0.000000 - MVC architecture.
0.034364 - Model A model is a representation of reality.
0.086022 - Most system models can be represented graphically.
0.020050 - It could be either a single object or it could contain multiple objects with relationships among them.
0.043011 - There are several notations for data modeling.
0.063116 - The actual model is usually called “entity relationship diagram” (ERD) since it explains the data in terms of the entities and relationships described by the data.
0.053333 - We need a concept to abstractly represent all instances of a group of similar things.
0.000000 - This concept is called an entity.
0.039604 - An entity is something we want to store data.
0.105073 - These entities have attributes and behaviors similar to those found in the real world.
0.079096 - A key benefit of implementing our own domain model is that we could design it according to the language and terminology dietitians are using in their daily practices.
0.082596 - This makes it much easier for developers to communicate with entire team.
0.103286 - Finding a suitable name for our entities, operations, and relationships that makes sense not only to the developers but also professional dietetics would really benefit the entire team and increase the efficiency of communication among all parties.
0.028674 - View A view visually represents a model.
0.049217 - Usually it would only display certain parts of the model therefore it is acting as some kind of a presentation filter.
0.103359 - It is attached to the model and gets the data from the model by issuing queries.
0.077135 - A view may also update the model by sending the model some predefined instructions.
0.046512 - In web applications, the view is usually a HTML file which might contain some JavaScript codes.
0.039216 - It is also possible to return a view in XML format or other format such as a spreadsheet or a PDF file.
0.132581 - Controller A controller links a user to the system.
0.027548 - It provides users with input capabilities with one or a combination of multiple views.
0.062016 - It receives user inputs and presents users with the output of the program using different views.
0.102982 - System architecture The architecture of the system is shown in Fig 3-4.
0.108031 - First, the dietetic professionals create the nutrition diagnosis guidelines based on their researches and experiences which in this study we used the research result from a Department of Health of Taiwan, “Establishing and studying the model of nutritional diagnosis” (Lee, 2005).
0.119352 - Then knowledge engineers work with dietetics professionals to convert the guideline into computer readable rules by using a rule editor with IntelliSense support.
0.097456 - Nutrition diagnosis expert system architecture Fig 3-4.
0.111434 - Nutrition diagnosis expert system architecture.
0.115479 - Development tools The nutrition expert system is developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 and is written in C# programming language.
0.067278 - The backend database is Microsoft SQL server 2008 developer’s edition.
0.039604 - The finished web application is hosted on Microsoft Windows.
0.134427 - Table 3-1 presents the software tools used to develop the nutritional diagnosis expert system.
0.000000 - Table 3-1.
0.018265 - Development tools.

0.000000 - Implementation 3.4.1.
0.082687 - Domain model analysis The first step of implementing a program is to create a domain model.
0.068376 - The method of modeling I will be using is called domain-driven design.
0.088889 - This methodology models the objects to represent the problem domain.
0.048000 - The domain model is the object graph which represents the business domain of the software.
0.060471 - They are rich objects with properties and methods that mimic the behaviors as in the real world.
0.120495 - We need to figure out what our major entities are in the system.
0.048662 - Basically, we will do so by picking out the nouns from requirement statement such as the following: 1.
0.014337 - A patient will visit dietitians many times.
0.056645 - Dietitian will record the patient’s physical exam findings, anthropometric measurement, biochemical data from lab tests, as well as food/nutrition histories.
0.070365 - A visit will result in one or more nutritional diagnosis.
0.102776 - The system has many accounts.
0.125774 - The account has to enter a password in order to use the system.
0.106284 - We use this set of nouns as our starting point to identify the entities we will have in the system.
0.119546 - I have listed the major entities for our nutritional diagnosis expert system in Table 3-2.
0.000000 - Table 3-2.
0.000000 - Major entities.
0.065041 - Entities Account Anthropometric measurement BioChemical data Diagnosis Diseases Food nutrition history Lab test Patient Physical exam finding Visit Once we have our initial list of entities, we need to map the relationships among these objects.
0.126611 - Fig 3-5 shows the domain model of the nutrition diagnosis expert system.
0.110576 - The domain model forms the core structure of our expert system.
0.106746 - Nutrition diagnosis expert system domain model Fig 3-5.
0.121330 - Nutrition diagnosis expert system domain model.
0.088945 - The data model focuses on what would be stored in the database.
0.054983 - The database design process includes the following steps.
0.000000 - Requirement collection.
0.066007 - During this step, the developer interviews the database user.
0.075601 - Developers gain the detailed knowledge of data requirement.
0.014981 - Database schema Database schema is created.
0.050794 - It is the description of data requirements of the users.
0.039604 - It includes descriptions of data types, relationships and constraints.
0.028674 - Actual implementation of database 3.4.2.
0.049383 - Entity relationship model (ERM) Dr. Peter Chen presented his paper, “The entity – relationship model – toward a unified view of data” at the International Conference on Very Large Databases in September, 1975.
0.012698 - He claimed that his Entity Relational Model (Chen, 1976): 1.
0.069333 - “Adopts the more natural view that the real world consists of entities and relationships.” 2.

0.055417 - Chronic kidney disease The increase in the number of patients with chronic kidney disease has prompted the National Institute of Health to include CKD as a focus area in the Healthy People 2010 initiative (Healthy People 2010, 2000).
0.079096 - Healthy People 2010 is a set of health objectives for United States to achieve over the first decade of the new century proposed by National Institute of Health.
0.071842 - One of the objectives in the 2010 guidelines is to reduce the rate of new cases of end stage renal disease.
0.068376 - Another one is to reduce the mortality rate related to chronic kidney disease.
0.030132 - Chronic kidney disease is defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 of body surface area for ⩾3 months (Levey et al., 2005).
0.067925 - The prevalence rate of chronic kidney disease in US is 4.7% and has become the nation’s ninth leading cause of death and it was estimated the cost of health care for end stage renal disease would cost US$28.3 billion by 2010 (Kuo, Tsai, Tiao, & Yang, 2007).
0.057189 - In United Kingdom, the number of end stage renal disease has doubled in the past decade.
0.058667 - In Taiwan, chronic kidney disease has been the eighth leading cause of death since 1997.

0.072693 - Both incidence and prevalence of end stage renal disease are among the highest in the world.
0.056460 - Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM) for hemodialysis patients According to Devereaux, despite technological advances in dialysis techniques, the mortality rate in the states for dialysis patients is unacceptably high at around 20% per year (Devereaux et al., 2002).
0.054054 - PEM is one of the major risk predictor of death for dialysis patients; it is also believed that nutritional intervention might improve the poor outcome in dialysis patients (Kaysen, 2000).
0.106411 - System evaluation We have decided to select CKD patients who are under hemodialysis treatment as out test subjects and we will focus on the nutritional diagnosis of Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM) for these patients.
0.045855 - In this study, we have sampled 100 such patients from a university hospital and recorded each patient’s albumin, cholesterol, creatinine level before dialysis and BMI calculated with patients’ dry weight.

0.152633 - We also recorded the time for both human expert and the expert system’s nutritional diagnosis time to make a comparison.
0.064000 - The definition of Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM) for dialysis patient is as the following: 1.
0.000000 - Albumin < 4.0 g/dL or PreAlbumin ⩽ 30 mg/dL.
0.000000 - Cholestrol ⩽ 150 mg/dL.
0.000000 - Creatitine before dialysis < 10 mg/dL.
0.040609 - BMI based on dry weight < 18.5 kg/m2 or lost of dry weight of more than 10% in 6 months or lost of dry weight of more than 5% in 1 month.
0.064018 - In our rule base, it is converted to the following syntax using the Rule Set Editor: (this.Albumin < 4.0 || this.PreAlbumin ⩽ 30) && this.Cholesterol ⩽ 150 && this.CreatinineLevelBeforeDialysis < 10 && (this.Anthro.Contains(2) || this.Anthro.Contains(3) || this.DryBMI < 18.5) && (this.DiseaseList.Contains(2) || this.DiseaseList.Contains(3)).
0.064751 - Nutritional diagnosis result Our test result shows that human expert has diagnosed 7 patients out of 100 patients with Protein-Energy Malnutrition (PEM) while our expert system diagnosed four patients with PEM as presented in Table 4–2.
0.084965 - After careful re-examination and discussion with professional dietetics, we concluded that the human expert misdiagnosed three patients while the expert system correctly diagnosed all 100 patients.
0.136010 - Therefore, our expert system is more accurate than a human expert.
0.122258 - Table 4–3 presents the patients diagnosed with PEM HD by nutritional diagnosis expert system and the dietitian.

0.088197 - Dietitian Expert system Diagnosis rules 1 50 Average diagnosis time 1.96 s 1.3 s
0.000000 - Research limitation 1.
0.077258 - Due to the time limit of this study, we can only focus on a single nutritional diagnosis for a particular patient group, namely PEM for hemodialysis patient.
0.064016 - In the future we could examine other diagnosis as well.
0.081674 - In this study, we rely heavily on labor intensive manual input of various patient data such as patient basic data, biochemical data, anthropometric measurement, physical exam findings, and food/nutrition history since the system is not connected to the hospital information system directly.
0.092228 - This results in the lack of efficiency and redundancy of labor.
0.090724 - We suggest in the future research, the system could connect directly with hospital information system to retrieve relevant patient data directly to reduce the workload of dietitians in the clinical setting and therefore increase the usability of the system.
0.105807 - Nutritional diagnosis rules (a) Need to find a way to deal with descriptive data types so that the rules could include other data such as physical exam findings and food/nutrition histories in addition biochemical data and anthropometric measurements.
0.105584 - (b) Need to define which rules are applicable which disease more precisely for each nutritional diagnosis definition.
0.107358 - For example, a nutritional diagnosis of overweight, for subjects without hemodialysis, the diagnosis rule is 24 ⩽ BMI < 27.
0.057143 - Here, we calculate the BMI based on subjects’ body weight.
0.052288 - However, when the subjects are hemodialysis patients, we would need to use subjects’ dry weight to calculate BMI instead of body weight.
0.055459 - This is not clearly stated in the research result of Lee’s study in 2005 (Lee, 2005).
0.058997 - (c) Need to make sure that there are no contradictions in diagnosis.
0.082645 - (d) Need to adopt a standard terminology in terms of descriptive signs and symptoms.
0.108434 - After completing the programming of nutritional expert system I have built for this study, during testing phase, I have found that the performance of the system is not very fast.
0.072015 - It took longer time than I have expected to come up with nutritional diagnosis.
0.118204 - When trying to tune up the system for faster diagnosis performance, I have found out that the main culprit is in the database access methodology that I have chosen.
0.008949 - I found out that Entity Framework 1.0 which Microsoft released with Visual Studio 2008 SP1 does not perform very well.
0.077135 - I have written a performance test program to compare 4 types of database access.
0.088398 - For each method, I queried against the database to list a patient’s diseases for one thousand times and recorded the time it took for the program to execute.
0.048110 - The result is listed in Table 5–1.
0.027586 - The result shows that the fastest method is with SQL DataSet while the slowest one is Entity Framework 1.0.
0.010336 - While Entity Framework brings many programming features, we must also consider its downside of performance issue.
0.084885 - I would recommend in the future research; we might find another method to write the codes for the database access part of the program to prevent the performance issue.
