0.205332 - The results may potentially contribute to give a recommendation how to design intervention, to conduct a treatment in order to reduce anxiety and further to improve student’s academic performance.
0.151915 - The studies anxiety is situation that refers to anxiety condition during study in term of the perception that high level anxiety relate to obtain of low academic performance.
0.096070 - The sources can create as well increased students’ anxiety levels while study process, its make students have bad experience then they will keep the experience for next situations.
0.075472 - Such anxiety can interfere with students’ performance on exam (Harris & Coy, 2003; McCraty, 2003).
0.079235 - According to Spielberger in Sansgiry and Kavita (2006) found that exam anxiety as a situation-specific trait that refers to the anxiety states and worry conditions that are experienced during examinations.
0.070336 - Too much anxiety can interrupt exam performance, researchers have been investigated that exam anxiety mostly to negative effect on academic performance (Sansgiry & Kavita, 2006).
0.078212 - High degree of anxiety can block thoughts, create negative frame in mind, and potential of poor exam performance.
0.061135 - Researcher report that student who is not well prepared for exam may have higher levels of task interfering worry during examination than those are better prepared (Pecoraro, 2006).
0.180287 - The traditional main objectives of grouping student suffering study’ anxiety are to deal with the uncertainty due to design intervention, to conduct a treatment to reduce anxiety and further to improve student’s academic performance.
0.055556 - To achieve this objective, certain clustering techniques are also being applied.
0.071279 - Clustering a set of objects into homogeneous classes is an important Data mining operation.
0.087794 - The clustering operation is required in a number of data analysis tasks, such as unsupervised classification and data summation, as well as segmentation of large homogeneous data sets into smaller homogeneous subsets that can be easily managed, separately modeled and analyzed (Huang, 1998).
0.086102 - A well-known approach for data clustering is using rough set theory (Pawlak, 1982, 1991; Pawlak & Skowron, 2007).
0.071204 - For example, Mazlack, He, Zhu, and Coppock (2000) had developed a rough set approach in choosing partitioning attributes.
0.091672 - One of the successful pioneering rough clustering for categorical data techniques is Minimum–Minimum Roughness (MMR) proposed by Parmar, Wu, and Blackhurst (2007).
0.063456 - However, pure rough set theory is not well suited for analyzing noisy information systems.
0.065163 - As there is little support by commercial DBMSs to reduce errors that occur during data-entry and there is virtually nothing that a DBMS can do to catch errors that occur during the collection process, noise is prevailing in real-world applications and comes from many sources, including erroneous attribute values in samples and/or erroneous classification of samples to wrong classes.
0.111857 - A knowledge discovery system must be tolerant to the occurrence of noise.
0.065760 - For example, in the previous work on constructing student models through mining students classification-test answer sheets by Wang and Hung (2001), much noise was found in the classification tables, either the feature values or the class values, created by students.
0.114379 - Some of the noises might come from the students erroneous inputs and the others might be due to the students internal inconsistent believes.
0.108774 - Their empirical results showed that attention should be paid to handle the noisy information in order to reach a satisfactory prediction accuracy (Wang, 2005).
0.187983 - In order to overcome this issue, the variable precision rough set (VPRS) (Ziarko, 1991, 2002) technique is used.
0.087102 - The VPRS model, firstly proposed by Ziarko (1991), is an effective mathematical tool with an error-tolerance capability to handle uncertainty problem.
0.106903 - Basically, the VPRS is an extension of Pawlaks rough set theory (Pawlak, 1982, 1991; Pawlak & Skowron, 2007), allowing for partial classification.
0.106062 - By setting a confidence threshold value β, the VPRS cannot only solve classification problems with uncertain data and no functional relationship between attributes, but also relax the rigid boundary definition of Pawlaks rough set model to improve the model suitability.
0.081937 - Due to the existence of β, the VPRS can resist data noise or remove data errors (Slezak & Ziarko, 2005).
0.077381 - In order to determine a rational change interval for β (Xie, Zhang, Lai, & Yu, 2008), It will give us a new way to deal with the noisy data.
0.153849 - We present a real dataset of student’s suffering anxiety.
0.244183 - This data were taken from a survey aimed to identify of study anxiety sources among university students.
0.111448 - In this survey, 770 Universiti Malaysia Pahang’s students are involved and asked about experiences, feels, and thoughts of anxiety during study process.
0.102394 - The results identify seven anxiety’s sources, i.e., mathematic anxiety, language anxiety, family anxiety, library anxiety, exam anxiety, presentation anxiety, and social anxiety.
0.174213 - Descriptive statistics is used to find out the Mean (M) and Standard Deviation (SD) to identify the five potential sources of study anxiety.
0.137060 - It is ran in SPSS version 16.0 and the results show that there are five potential sources of study anxiety, i.e., exam anxiety, class presentation anxiety, mathematic anxiety, language anxiety and social anxiety.
0.243005 - Using Variable Precision Rough Set Model, we present how student suffering anxiety can be grouped.
0.172584 - Grouping of such student may potentially contribute to give a recommendation how to design intervention, to conduct a treatment in order to reduce anxiety and further to improve student’s academic performance.
0.094527 - The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
0.203416 - Section 2 describes the notion of information systems, set approximations and variable precision rough set model.
0.106377 - Section 3 describes VPRS model for selecting a clustering attribute in data clustering and the technique for grouping the objects based on the attribute selected.
0.150739 - Section 4 describes the study’s anxiety datasets.
0.100305 - The results and visualization are obtained in Section 5.
0.097222 - Finally, the conclusion of this work is described in Section 6.
0.127956 - The observation that one cannot distinguish objects on the basis of given information about them is the starting point of rough set theory.
0.039801 - In other words, imperfect information causes indiscernibility of objects.
0.079665 - The indiscernibility relation induces an approximation space made of equivalence classes of indiscernible objects.
0.096386 - A rough approximating a subset of the set of objects is a pair of dual set approximations, called a lower and an upper approximation in term of these equivalence classes (Pawlak, 1982).
0.069865 - Rough sets are defined through their dual set approximations in an information system.
0.109347 - The notion of information system provides a convenient tool for the representation of objects in terms of their attribute values.
0.048969 - Information system and set approximations An information system is a 4-tuple (quadruple) S = (U, A, V, f), where U = {u1, u2, u3, … , u∣U∣} is a non-empty finite set of objects, A = {a1, a2, a3, … , a∣A∣} is a non-empty finite set of attributes, V = ∪ a∈AVa, Va is the domain (value set) of attribute a, f : U × A → V is an information function such that f(u, a) ∈ Va, for every (u, a) ∈ U × A, called information (knowledge) function.
0.120324 - The starting point of rough set approximations is the indiscernibility relation, which is generated by information about objects of interest.
0.044693 - Two objects in an information system are called indiscernible (indistinguishable or similar) if they have the same feature.
0.093279 - Definition 2.1 Two elements x, y ∈ U are said to be B-indiscernible (indiscernible by the set of attribute B ⊆ A in S) if and only if f(x, a) = f(y, a), for every a ∈ B.
0.044776 - Obviously, every subset of A induces unique indiscernibility relation.
0.091908 - Notice that, an indiscernibility relation induced by the set of attribute B, denoted by IND(B), is an equivalence relation.
0.064156 - The partition of U induced by IND(B) is denoted by U/B and the equivalence class in the partition U/B containing x ∈ U, in denoted by [x]B.
0.117400 - The notions of lower and upper approximations of a set are defined as follows.
0.052045 - Definition 2.2 See Ziarko, 2002 The B-lower approximation of X, denoted by B(X) and B-upper approximation of X, denoted by , respectively, are defined by B(X) = {x ∈ U∣[x]B ⊆ X} and .
0.117398 - The accuracy of approximation (accuracy of roughness) of any subset X ⊆ U with respect to B ⊆ A, denoted αB (X) is measured by where ∣X∣ is the cardinality of X.
0.026882 - For empty set ϕ, we define αB(ϕ) = 1.
0.052910 - Obviously, 0 ⩽ αB(X) ⩽ 1 if X is a union of some equivalence classes of U, then αB(X) = 1.
0.129630 - Thus, the set X is crisp (precise) with respect to B.
0.057471 - And, if X is not a union of some equivalence classes of U, then αB(X) < 1.
0.120370 - Thus, the set X is rough (imprecise) with respect to B.
0.124688 - This means that the higher of accuracy of approximation of any subset X ⊆ U is the more precise (the less imprecise) of itself.
0.091840 - While, The original Pawlak’s formulations lower and upper approximation are based on the set inclusion and set overlap operators respectively (Pawlak, 1982).
0.082192 - Although, it is sufficient in many applications, there are situations in which the original, set inclusion operator-based formulation of lower and upper is too restrictive.
0.112695 - To deal with this problem, the more relaxed formulation of lower and upper approximations in terms of controlled degree of overlap between sets rather than the inclusion relation was introduced in Ziarko (1991) in the context of the variable precision rough set (Ziarko, 2002).
0.135244 - Variable precision rough set Variable precision rough set (VPRS) extends rough set theory by the relaxation of the subset operator (Ziarko, 1991).
0.039448 - It was proposed to analyze and identify data patterns which represent statistical trends rather than functional.
0.097152 - The main idea of VPRS is to allow objects to be classified with an error smaller than a certain pre-defined level.
0.111198 - This introduced threshold relaxes the rough set notion of requiring no information outside the dataset itself.
0.038314 - Definition 2.3 Let a set U as a universe and X, Y ⊆ U, where X, Y ≠ ϕ.
0.071197 - The error classification rate of X relative to Y is denoted by e(X, Y), is defined by Definition 2.4 Let U be a finite set and let β be a real number within the range 0 ⩽ β < 0.5 and a set X ⊆ U.
0.078048 - The Bβ-lower approximation of X, denoted by Bβ(X) and Bβ-upper approximation of X, denoted by , respectively, are defined by The set Bβ(X) is called the positive region of X. It’s the set of object of U that can be classified into X with error classification rate not greater than β.
0.083223 - Then we have if only if 0 ⩽ β < 0.5, which means that be restricted in an interval [0, 0.5) in order to keep the meaning of the “upper” and “lower” approximations.
0.208240 - In this section, we will present the proposed technique, which we refer to as Maximum Accuracy of Variable Precision Rough Set.
0.243949 - The technique uses the accuracy of approximation using variable precision of attributes in the rough set theory.
0.203101 - The accuracy of approximation using variable precision of attributes is higher than stranded approximation for selecting clustering attribute.
0.190684 - Proposition 3.1 prove that the accuracy of approximation using variable precision of attributes is more accurate for selecting clustering attribute.
0.173732 - Definition 3.1 The accuracy of approximation variable precision (accuracy of variable precision roughness) of any subset X ⊆ U with respect to B ⊆ A is denoted by .
0.057926 - It is presented as where ∣X∣ denotes cardinality of X.
0.158789 - If β = 0, it is the traditional rough set model of Pawlak.
0.126959 - Proposition 3.1 Let S = (U, A, V, f) be an information system, αB(X) be an accuracy of roughness and is an accuracy of variable precision roughness given the error factor of variable precision.
0.000000 - .
0.024353 - Proof Based on Definition 2.4, if β ⩾ 0.5, then .
0.008949 - Thus, for 0 ⩽ β < 0.5, we have B0(X) ⊇ Bβ(X) and .
0.000000 - Consequently, ∣B0(X)∣ ⩽ ∣Bβ(X)∣ and .
0.038106 - For β = 0, based on Definition 3.1, .
0.009259 - For 0 < β < 0.5, we have ∣B0(X)∣ ⩽ ∣Bβ(X)∣ and .
0.000000 - Hence Therefore, .
0.054076 - □ Definition 3.2 Suppose ai ∈ A, V(ai) has k-different values, say γk, k = 1, 2, … , n. Let X(ai = γk), k = 1, 2, … , n be a subset of the objects having k-different values of attribute ai.
0.011204 - Lets any β be an error factor.
0.088094 - The accuracy of the set X(ai = γk), k = 1, 2, … , n, with respect to aj, where i ≠ j, denoted , is defined by (1) The mean accuracy of attribute ai ∈ A with respect to aj ∈ A, where i ≠ j, denoted by , is evaluated as follows (2) where V(ai) is the set of values of attribute ai ∈ A.
0.128227 - Definition 3.3 Given n attributes, mean variable precision roughness of attribute ai ∈ A with respect to aj ∈ A, where i ≠ j, refers to the mean of , denoted MA (ai), is obtained by the following formula (3) Fig 1 shows the pseudo-code of the proposed technique.
0.094771 - Suppose that in an information system, there are n objects, m attributes and l is the maximum of distinct values of each attribute.
0.098434 - The VPRS needs nm computation for determining elementary set of all attribute.
0.091255 - The computation of calculating error classifications all subsets of U having different value of attribute ai and mean accuracy of attribute ai with respect to all aj, where i ≠ j is n2l.
0.190086 - The computation of calculating mean variable precision roughness of all attributes is n times.
0.095238 - Thus, the computational complexity of VPRS is of the polynomial ○(n2l + mn + n).

0.047962 - Then, we will select a clustering attribute among all candidates.
0.084656 - To obtain the values of VPRS, firstly, we must obtain the equivalence classes induced by indisceribility relation of singleton attribute.
0.089485 - The five partitions of objects from Table 1 are shown as follow.
0.023392 - a. X(Degree = B.Sc.)
0.000000 - = {1, 2}, X(Degree = M.Sc.)

X(Statistics = no) = {1, 3, 4, 6}, X(Statistics = yes) = {2, 5, 7, 8}, d. X(Programming = fluent) = {1, 4, 7, 8}, X(Programming = poor) = {2, 3, 5, 6}, e. X(Mathematics = poor) = {1, 3, 4, 7}, X(Mathematics = fluent) = {2, 5, 6, 8}, Based on Definition 2.3, the error classification attribute Statistics with respect to Degree are calculated as follow.
