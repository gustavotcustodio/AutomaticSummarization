0.064725 - The tradeoff between complexity of structure and the fitness of the network model is also a key issue (Brin, Motwani, & Silverstein, 1997).
0.119403 - Therefore, constructing an appropriate network model is really a challenge.
0.065163 - Many studies of PNs have been proposed to deal with the modeling and verification of the knowledge based systems lately (Hagalisletto, Bjørk, Yu, & Enger, 2007; Huang & Kirchner, 2013; Motallebi & Azgomi, 2012).
0.051150 - For instance, fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) and fuzzy neural Petri nets (FNPNs) have been proposed to represent a fuzzy knowledge base and fuzzy reasoning system (Ashon, 1995).

0.055375 - Besides, a knowledge representation scheme based on Fuzzy petri nets (FPNs) called DRFK (Dynamic Representation of Fuzzy Knowledge) is proposed for dynamic knowledge representation and inference (Wang, Peng, Zhu, Hu, & Peng, 2014).
0.106918 - However, constructing an appropriate network model for decision making is a challenge because it is hard to systematically transfer from a complex system.
0.045714 - Thus, most current work related to modified PNs have focused on applying reasoning mechanisms over production rules, rather than proposing a systematic construction method in building PNs (Chandra & Varghese, 2009; García-Pedrajas & Ortiz-Boyer, 2007; Gulati & Tanniru, 1993; S’lezak, 2009; Zahid, Mittal, & Joshi, 2006).
0.041379 - Over the past few years, several studies have addressed this modeling problem with little progress (Chandra & Varghese, 2009; García-Pedrajas & Ortiz-Boyer, 2007; Liu, Li, Barkaoui, & Al-Ahmari, 2013; Hajdasz, 2014; Faghihi, Reinschmidt, & Kang, 2014).

0.258020 - Section 4 presents an experiment of APN model construction for malicious e-mail detection.
0.118837 - The evaluation, analysis and discussion of constructed APN models are described in Section 5.
0.000000 - Finally, conclusions summarized in Section 6.
0.059140 - An APN is a directed graph containing three types of nodes: places, squares and transitions, where circles represent places, squares represent thresholds of association degree and bars represent transitions.
0.042194 - Each place contains a token associated with a truth-value between zero and one.
0.050633 - Each transition is associated with a certainty factor (CF) value between zero and one.
0.022989 - Directed arcs represent the relationships between places.
0.034739 - A generalized APN structure, as shown in Fig 1, is defined as a 13-tuple (Shih et al., 2007): where is a finite set of places, is a finite set of transitions, is a finite set of supports, is a finite set of propositions, is a finite set of thresholds of the supports, is a finite set of thresholds of the confidences, is an input function, a mapping from transitions to bags of places, is an output function, a mapping from transitions to bags of places, is an association function that assigns a real value between zero to one to each transition, is an association function, a mapping from places to real values between zero and one, is an association function, a bijective mapping from places to propositions, is an association function that assigns a real value between zero to one to each support, is a function that assigns both threshold of support and confidence.

0.054422 - A generalized APN structure.
0.043716 - Let A be a set of directed arcs.
0.057143 - If then there exists a directed arc from place to transition .
0.057143 - If then there exists a directed arc from transition to place .
0.097561 - If [0,1], then the support is said to be associated with a real value .
0.081301 - If [0,1], then transition is said to be associated with a real value ci.
0.089552 - If then place is said to be associated with proposition .
0.118838 - An associative Petri net with some places containing tokens is called a marked associative Petri net.
0.099593 - In a marked associative Petri net, the token in a place is represented by a labeled dot .
0.045662 - The token value in a place is denoted by where [0,1].
0.049751 - If and then the degree of truth of proposition is .
0.041667 - Let A and B be two sets of items.
0.067511 - The support and confidence of an implication of the form are defined as Eqs.
0.018265 - (1) and (2) with probability and conditional probability (Agrawal, Imielinski, & Swami, 1993).
0.038567 - Which are, (1) (2) Typically, association rules in APNs are considered if they both satisfy a minimum support threshold , [0,1], and a minimum confidence threshold , [0,1].
0.039216 - These thresholds are usually assigned according to previous experience or by domain experts (Han & Kamber, 2001).
0.096140 - In an APN model, if both value of support and confidence are higher than their threshold τ and γ, then the transition is enabled with its confidence (CF = ), else the relationship does not exist (CF = 0).
0.060150 - The general formulation of the certainty factor is shown in Eq (3): (3) where is the confidence, γ is a threshold of confidence,s is the support and τ is a threshold of support.
0.116921 - By carefully reserving related places and assigning certainty factors to transitions, we can come up with a live APN that facilitates APN model construction.
0.090698 - According to the definition of APN and Fig 1, pi is represent a place in APNs model, pi ∈P and di is represent a proposition di ∈D.
0.078947 - If = di then place pj is said to be associated with proposition dj.
0.076602 - Therefore, the APNs models of basic devices are obtained directly from considering the variables that match to the places of the net and considering the associative degree between places and places that match to the transitions based on the Eqs.
0.000000 - (1) and (2).
0.048930 - For example, the following is an associative production rule: R1: IF email with Attachment THEN Attachment file type is exe..etc (CF = 0.8).
0.020833 - Let λ be a threshold value, where λ = 0 ∈ [0, 1].
0.059765 - λ = 1 shows that the proposition exists and λ = 0 shows the proposition does not exist.
0.087428 - If the λ = 1 of place p1 and p2 are repress that they exit in an APN model, β(pi) and β(pj) are “email with Attachment” and “Attachment file type is exe..etc.”.
0.063927 - It indicates that the degree of truth of the proposition , is * ci.
0.029963 - If the degree of truth of the proposition “email with Attachment” is 0.90 and the threshold value λ = 1, then the rule R1 can be fired, and the degree of truth of the proposition “Attachment file type is exe..etc” is 0.9 * 0.8 = 0.72.
0.056911 - It indicates that the possibility of Attachment file type is exe..etc is 0.72.
0.052632 - APNs can provide the visualization of the dynamic behavior of rule-based system.
0.124702 - However, building an APN model for decision making is a challenge.
0.096491 - How to choose association rules that may conflict or different with each other?
0.132340 - How to avoid cycle-structures during model construction?
0.168170 - To resolve these problems, a novel APN-mesh model construction algorithm is proposed.
0.102424 - To express most of association rules and relationship between two places in APNs, idea of leaving all the connecting relations and avoiding cycle-structures during model construction is necessary.
0.104667 - The flowchart of an APN-mesh model construction is shown in Fig 2 and described as follows: Construction flowchart of an APN-mesh model Fig 2.
0.137931 - Construction flowchart of an APN-mesh model.
0.087595 - First of all, Chi Square Test of Independence is used to determine the strength of dependence between a pair of places and (Brin et al., 1997).
0.028571 - The Chi Square Test of independence proceeds in two stages: 1.
0.020833 - Hypotheses H0:Two variables are independent in the population.
0.021858 - H1:Two variables are related in the population.
0.019900 - Statistic Test: (4) where , and denotes the chi-square statistics.
0.033854 - N is the total number of observations, is the number of observations with in state k and in state is the number of observations with in state is the number of observations with in state l, denotes the probability that is in state k, denotes the probability that is in state and are two variables or features where one is a column variable while the other is row variable in a contingency table.
0.038095 - f is large enough, a strong dependency exists between places and .
0.035897 - After computing the Chi-square statistics between every pair of the places, we can set a significance α for p-value filtering where p-value is defined as P( ∣ Degrees of Freedom).
0.056738 - If p-value is less than α, we reject the null hypotheses H0 and establish a link between two places.
0.090909 - In step 2, the association rule concept is applied to determine the structure of the APN-mesh.
0.050633 - The support value between and are measured with Eq (1) in given data set.
0.056911 - If the support is greater than predetermined threshold , then this link is left between pairs.
0.113432 - After checking every pair and connecting goal places to all other places with support , we can obtain an intermediate network in APN-mesh model construction.
0.017544 - In step 3, we should identify the antecedent-consequence relationship in the mesh.
0.070922 - In many situations, it is hard to confirm the existence of an antecedent-consequence relationship between the propositions and .
0.019900 - Therefore, we compare the confidence value and between proposition and .
0.047619 - The antecedent-consequence relationship with a directed link is then determined based on which is the higher confidence value between a pair of places and .
0.066667 - In the event of a tie, its direction is randomly chosen.
0.045977 - Thus, a directed mesh structure is obtained.
0.075269 - Usually, an APN-mesh structure has four types of places: Starting places: A place is the antecedent proposition of other places and no other places are its antecedent proposition.
0.063830 - Temporal places: A place is the consequence proposition of other places and no other places are its consequence proposition.
0.060000 - Intermediate places: A place is not only the antecedent proposition of other places but also the consequence proposition of other places.
0.020833 - Island places: A place has no antecedent-consequence relationship.
0.101961 - The starting places are used as input places to model the antecedent propositions of connected places.
0.036530 - The intermediate places are responsible for connecting starting places with temporal places.
0.050847 - We assume that island places have a direct influence on the goal place, thus the arrows emanating from island places point directly to a final goal place.
0.065041 - On the other hand, the temporal places also point directly to a final goal place.
0.034364 - Likewise, some antecedent-consequence relationships may be pruned if the strength of their relationships does not meet a predefined threshold.
0.060000 - In other words, if a confidence value between places and is lower than its threshold , an antecedent-consequence relationship is pruned.
0.058608 - On the other hand, a cycle-structure is not allowed in PNs since it may cause an oscillation.
0.068729 - Thus, we should avoid cyclic structures, as shown in Fig 3, during the construction of APN-mesh in step 4.
0.086607 - A cycle-structure search algorithm is used from the starting places.
0.036530 - These cycle-structures are broken by pruning the link with minimal confidence.
0.035461 - If two or more links have the same minimal confidence level, one of them is chosen randomly for pruning.
0.038095 - The cyclic structures (a) Three places (b) Four places Fig 3.
0.041667 - The cyclic structures (a) Three places (b) Four places.
0.075362 - Step 5, the certainty factor of a transition in an APN-mesh can confirm the existence of an antecedent-consequence relationship from proposition to proposition if .
0.068627 - To measure the association degree between the antecedent and consequence portion in an APN, confidence in Eq (2) is assigned as a transition between the antecedent and consequence portions in an APN- mesh.
0.043860 - Confidence value represents the strength between a pair of propositions and (place and ).
0.029851 - Thus, the CF() function of each transition can be identified.
0.114943 - Finally, an APN-mesh model is accomplished.
0.135021 - A detailed construction algorithm of proposed APN-mesh model is shown in Fig 4.

0.029851 - The sampled emails include 1859 benign and 96 malicious emails.
0.015686 - All these emails were downloaded from various FTP sites and audited by a commercial virus scanner.
0.129852 - Malicious emails discovered from 1999 to 2004 were used to decision model construction, and malicious emails after 2004 were adopted for the APN model evaluation in Section 4.3.
0.014652 - These malicious email samples could be referenced at <http://smartlab.mis.yuntech.edu.tw/research/Data_emcode.htm>.
0.032520 - The malicious email gathered consisted of Internet worms (IW), Trojans, macros, scripts and file-infectors.
0.072375 - A detailed description of the behavior of these malicious e-mails can be found in our previous studies (Shih & Chiang, 2004; Shih, Chiang, Chan, & Lin, 2004; Shih et al., 2007; Shih, Chiang, & Yen, 2005).

0.044150 - Number of attachments Varying file extension The extension of attachment is varying and questionable Changing subject line and message Subject line is usually very attractive and the message is camouflaged to seduce the users to run the attachment.
0.054983 - Mail content type Text/plain, text/html, other Mail size The size of mails less than 150 KB 4.1.
0.118837 - APN-mesh model building This section illustrates an example of APN-mesh model construction.
0.075993 - The construction algorithm, from Fig 2, provides a step-by-step approach to build an APN-mesh model as follow: Step 1: Determine components and communication structure Assume a set of variables, as in Table 1, with undirected links between places constructed from the dataset by the Chi-square test of independence.
0.025316 - If the value exceeds α = 0.05, then the link between places and is reserved.
0.059072 - The chi-square test of independence of all places is shown in Table 2.
0.050633 - A case of Chi-square test of independence for and is as follows: 1.
0.019900 - State the Hypotheses : Two variables are independent in the population.
0.022989 - : Two variables are related in the population.
0.024242 - Find the Test Statistic Table 2.

0.000000 - – 1.938 – 1.938 – 3.432 – 1.018 – 0.023 – 1.661 0.132 – 2.314 – 1.661 0.241 3.566 – 1.072 1.072 1.899 0.08 1.654 0.004 0.327 – (*, ** and *** are all reserved).
0.041237 - The test statistic of the Pearson Chi-square for and is 1.661 and the p-value is 0.197.
0.033333 - After computing the Chi-square statistics between and , we can obtain p-value = 0.197 which is greater than α = 0.05.
0.017544 - Thus, we accept the null hypotheses H0 and these two variables are independent.
0.022989 - Therefore, there is no link between and .
0.052758 - Step 2: Determine support structure The associative support between variables and in the given data set is calculated by Eq (1) and marked in the initial structure of network, as shown in Fig 5.
0.048780 - Those links for which support is less than predetermined thresholds ( = 0.05) are then pruned.
0.054645 - The resulting structure is given in Fig 6.
0.075601 - By connecting goal place to all places and calculating their support , an intermediate network structure is shown in Fig 7.

0.059524 - Step 3: Antecedent-consequence relationship identification The antecedent-consequence relationship between each pair of places is identified based on their association degree with each other.
0.039216 - Each directed line is determined by choosing the higher confidence value between each pair of places.
0.049550 - For example, there are two directed lines between and The confidence values and are calculated, and a directed line emanates from and is determined by pointing to since confidence () = 0.9011 is greater than confidence () = 0.8817.
0.035714 - Step 4: Acyclic structure establishment Once all the antecedent-consequence relationships are identified, relationships with confidence scores lower than predetermined threshold (0.5) are pruned.
0.043860 - In this example, , and are the starting places and is a temporal place.
0.000000 - There are no island places.
0.059701 - Then, we connect the temporal place to the goal place.
0.014652 - Fortunately, there are no cycle-structures in this example and it does not require the cycle reduction process.
0.052632 - Thus, a directed acyclic structure establishment is obtained as shown in Fig 8.
0.037879 - In step 5, we then identify the CF() function of each transition by confidence with Eq (2).
0.068729 - Finally, we incorporate the transitions into the network structure and obtain an APN-mesh model, as shown in Fig 9.
