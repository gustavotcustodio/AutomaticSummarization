We study Hong Kong Stock Exchange which was the second largest stock market in Asia up to 2010. We examine association of Hang Seng Index with other economics indices. Increasing RMB-HK exchange rate and export value will highly increase the variation of Hang Seng Index. Increasing RMB-HK exchange rate, export value and GDP will also highly increase the variation of Hang Seng Index. The minded rules reveal interesting patterns between different economical indices and the individual stock market price.

0.072289 - For instance, the support count of A.High is 4.2 and B.High is 4.1.
