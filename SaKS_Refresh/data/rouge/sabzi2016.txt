0.084683 - The efficiency of any FIS in targeting the expected values for specific inputs is directly related to both the structure of the FIS and the optimality of its MFPs; therefore, developing an optimal fuzzy inference system includes optimizing both the structure and the MFPs of the FIS.

[Frase 7] Overall, using evolutionary algorithms in a novel search engine led to superior performance, using the Takagi–Sugeno method led to near-optimum initial values for the MFPs, and developing a feedback monitoring system consistently led to reliable operating rules.
[Frase 47] After using the Takagi–Sugeno method to select appropriate initial membership function parameters, the FLCs utilized in the Diez Lagos (DL) flood control system were tuned and optimized through a novel dynamic tuning system that was developed in this study.
[Frase 246] In comparison to previous studies, the approach of this study in utilizing the search engine to ensure the optimality of the MFPs of the developed FLCs made it a very powerful system control tool whose approach can be extended to other dynamic systems and real time projects.
[Frase 44] The Takagi–Sugeno method was chosen due to the effect exerted by inference systems on the accuracy of FLC-derived output values.
[Frase 4] Therefore, this study employed several optimization approaches – ANFIS, GA, and PSO – within a defined search engine unit that compared the error values from the different approaches under different scenarios and, in each scenario, selected the results that had the minimum error value.
