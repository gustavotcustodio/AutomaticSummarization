A fuzzy-molecular based controller for coupled-tanks systems is proposed. Performance of our controller is higher over conventional PID controllers. Our controller is robust for different discharge rate levels at the secondary tank. Tracking and robustness experiments showed a steady-state error of 1 mm, in average.

0.155575 - This paper proposes a robust liquid-level controller for coupled-tanks systems when dealing with variable discharge rates at the secondary tank, based on a hybrid fuzzy inference system that uses artificial hydrocarbon networks at the defuzzification step, so-called fuzzy-molecular control.
0.153554 - The design methodology of the proposed controller is presented and discussed.
0.125658 - In addition, a case study was run over the CE105 TecQuipment coupled-tanks system in order to implement and validate the fuzzy-molecular controller proposed in that work.
0.143434 - A comparative evaluation with the proposed controller, a conventional PID controller specifically designed for this system and a QFT robust controller, was done.
0.075397 - Also, a performance evaluation in terms of robustness, reference-tracking in a fixed operating point and reference-tracking in a variable operating point on-the-fly was run and analyzed.
0.095798 - Results conclude that the proposed fuzzy-molecular controller deals with uncertainty and noise, can handle dynamics in operating point, a model of the plant is not required, and it is easy and simple to implement in comparison with other controllers in literature.
0.099405 - To this end, the proposed fuzzy-molecular liquid-level controller inherits characteristics from fuzzy controllers and artificial hydrocarbon networks in order to implement an advanced robust and intelligent control system.
0.096909 - Coupled-tanks systems are widely used in many industries.
0.040650 - They are occupied in processes where fluids have to be stored in tanks and then transferred to other tanks as required; maintaining some values, such as a specific height.
0.072842 - For example, applications of liquid level control approaches in coupled-tanks include: petrochemical industries, paper making, water treatment, food processing, beverage industries, pharmaceutical, and so forth (Abbas, Asghar, & Qamar, 2012; Holic & Vesely, 2011; Pan, Wonga, Kapilaa, & de Queiroz, 2005; Singh, Mukherjee, & Nikolaou, 2014).
0.092765 - However, these systems require efficient liquid level controllers, due to the necessity of pumping the liquid stored in a primary tank to a secondary tank that are actually coupled together (see Fig 3).
0.104144 - In particular to coupled-tanks systems, one of the main problems in liquid level controllers considers the failure of them for reference-tracking due to variations of parameters in the system like time varying of discharge rates in tanks (e.g.
0.037879 - variations in valve opening), falling in a dynamic set point.
0.110047 - In that sense, liquid level regulation in coupled-tanks systems can be handled using different control schemes.
0.042424 - Literature and industry distinguish these control approaches as: fixed-gain controllers, predictive controllers, robust controllers, and intelligent controllers (Abbas et al., 2012; Benayache & Castelain, 2009; Benayache, Mahmoud, Chrifi-Alaoui, Bussy, & Castelain, 2009; Holic & Vesely, 2011; Pan et al., 2005; Tahir, Iqbal, & Mustafa, 2009).
0.083772 - However, literature reports that fixed-gain controllers are inadequate when parameters of coupled-tanks systems are time varying and disturbances are present (Abbas et al., 2012; Liang, 2011).
0.163095 - In any case, the PID controller is the most used strategy in coupled-tanks systems (Holic & Vesely, 2011).
0.074074 - For instance, predictive controllers are designed for calculating future control signals that minimizes a cost function defined over a prediction horizon (Khalid & Kadri, 2012).
0.071958 - Several examples of this kind of control systems can be found, such as: the generalized predictive control (GPC), the most popular model predictive method (Clarke, Mohtadi, & Tuffs, 1987; Khalid & Kadri, 2012); or, the linear discrete-time model predictive control (DMPC) for multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) coupled-tanks systems (Khalid & Kadri, 2012).
0.093023 - Recently, Khalid and Kadri (2012) use a linear model predictive control (MPC) based on Laguerre functions for determining the path of the state space model of the plant and minimizing perturbances.
0.064516 - Alternately, robust controllers can deal with uncertainties, disturbances and time-varying systems (Abbas et al., 2012; Khan & Spurgeon, 2006).
0.142325 - Sliding mode control (SMC) is the most common robust control technique that has been implemented for coupled-tanks systems for overcoming disturbances and noise (Abbas et al., 2012).
0.145238 - However, chattering is an effect of SMC that causes a problem when dealing with controlling coupled-tanks systems.
0.077898 - In that way, Almutairi and Zribi (2006) implement SMC in coupled-tanks system for liquid level using one static and dynamic sliding mode schemes in order to reduce the chattering problem.
0.071539 - Other approaches of robust control are the second order sliding mode controller (SOSMC) developed for eliminating high frequency chattering due to high frequency switching (Benayache & Castelain, 2009; Benayache et al., 2009), and the second order sliding mode controller for MIMO systems (Khan & Spurgeon, 2006).
0.072318 - In the work of Khan and Spurgeon (2006), a second order SMC is proposed, reducing the chattering problem but also improving the algorithm to produce a dynamic control without requiring the derivative of the sliding variable that typically needs an observer or peak detectors to inspect singular values.
0.057018 - On the other hand, intelligent controllers (IC) are characterized for using algorithms and methods inspired on human intelligence, and more recently, on natural intelligence (Yu, 2009).
0.063333 - In that sense, fuzzy controllers and neural networks controllers have been well studied because they do not need an explicit mathematical model of the plant in order to be designed (Molina, Ponce, Ponce, Tello, & Ramirez, 2014; Yu, 2009).
0.065382 - In addition, these intelligent controllers have proved to be very efficient when dealing with nonlinearities, uncertainty and noise (Liang, 2011; Ponce, Ponce, & Molina, 2013), positioning intelligent controllers over fixed-gain, predictive and robust controllers.
0.111262 - For example, Lian, Marzuki, and Rubiyah (1998) proposes a hybrid neuro-fuzzy control system auto-tuning with genetic algorithms, providing an adaptive controller that handles noise, uncertainty and nonlinearities in liquid level coupled-tanks control systems.
0.175839 - In (Li, Yi, & Zhao, 2008), a type-II fuzzy control system is proposed to handle high uncertainty improving the characteristics of intelligent controllers for coupled-tanks liquid level systems.
0.077236 - This type-2 fuzzy control system includes a footprint of uncertainty in membership functions to deal with nonlinear relationships like disturbances and noise, also provides a dynamic operating point.
0.095238 - However, type-II fuzzy controllers are difficult to implement and spend a lot of computational resources.
0.072222 - Recently, literature reports hybrid intelligent and predictive or robust controllers in order to exploit characteristics from both schemes.
0.066667 - For example, Aliasghary, Ghasemzadeh, Naderi, and Pourazar (2011) propose an alternative robust controller using intelligent methods developing a hybrid radial basis function neural networks with a sliding mode control scheme, aiming to solve the chattering problem and to handle low uncertainty and noise.
0.076667 - Sarailoo, Rahmani, and Rezaie (2015) present a model predictive control using bees algorithm, a nature-inspired method, for minimizing a predefined cost function to find the best input signals subject to constrains and a model of the system.
0.157952 - From the above, liquid level coupled-tanks control system is still a challenging problem and a wide range of different controllers have been developed.
0.107222 - In that way, this paper proposes a novel intelligent controller for a coupled-tanks system, based on a recent hybrid fuzzy inference system and artificial organic networks approach so-called fuzzy-molecular inference system (Ponce et al., 2013).
0.047246 - This fuzzy-molecular inference system inherits characteristics from fuzzy inference systems (e.g.
0.029762 - storage of knowledge from experts, dealing with uncertainty, linguistic variables) and artificial organic networks (e.g.
0.053922 - packaging information in molecular units, organizing of information, dealing with aggresive uncertainty and noise), a learning method inspired on chemical organic compounds.
0.057119 - In advance, fuzzy-molecular inference system can deal with uncertainty and under aggressive conditions of noise, with relative easiness of implementation (Molina et al., 2014; Ponce et al., 2013).
0.141739 - Examples of fuzzy-molecular based controllers can be found in Molina et al.
0.015152 - (2014)Ponce, Ibarra, Ponce, and Molina (2014a), Ponce et al.
0.000000 - (2013, 2014b).
0.158262 - Thus, the objective of this work is to design, develop and implement an intelligent fuzzy-molecular liquid level controller for a coupled-tanks system in order to be robust in terms of any variation at the relative discharge rates of the second tank.
0.142770 - In addition, this paper presents the implementation of the proposed controller in a case study over the CE105 TecQuipment coupled-tanks system.
0.132616 - A comparative analysis with a conventional PID controller and a non-conventional quantitative feedback theory (QFT) controller, is presented and discussed.
0.188816 - In a nutshell, the contribution of this work is summarized following: • A novel intelligent controller based on fuzzy-molecular inference systems specifically for coupled-tanks systems is proposed.
0.155309 - • A simple but meaningful controller is described that overcomes uncertainty, noise and lack of robustness.
0.133772 - • A model of the plant is not required, so that the proposed controller can be easily generalized to other coupled-tanks systems, and it will not present chattering.

0.034483 - In a nutshell, artificial organic networks allow (Ponce et al., 2014b): modularity, inheritance, organizational, and structural stability.
0.043860 - On the other hand, artificial hydrocarbon networks is a supervised learning algorithm with a graphical model structure inspired on chemical hydrocarbon compounds (Ponce et al., 2014b).
0.027778 - Similar to chemical hydrocarbons, artificial hydrocarbon networks are composed of two atomic units: hydrogen and carbon atoms that can be linked with at most one and four other atoms, respectively.
0.000000 - Actually, these atomic units interact among them to produce molecules.
0.064103 - In particular to this method, the basic unit with information is the CH-molecule.
0.040351 - It is made of two or more atoms linked between them in order to define a mathematical function φ centered in the carbon atom and parameterized with hydrogen atoms attached to it, as shown in (1); where, represents the behavior of CH-molecule, σ is a real value called the carbon value, is the ith hydrogen atom linked to the carbon atom, k represents the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule, and x is the input to that molecule (Ponce et al., 2013; 2014b).
0.083333 - (1) If a CH-molecule is non-saturated (i.e.
0.027027 - k < 4), then it can be joined together with other CH-molecules with the same property, forming chains of molecules so-called artificial hydrocarbon compounds.
0.020833 - In Ponce et al.
0.040816 - (2014a, 2013), authors suggest using saturated linear chains of molecules like in (2); where, CHk represents a CH-molecule with k hydrogen atoms associated to it, and the line symbol represents a simple bond between two molecules.

0.063063 - (4) Formally, an artificial hydrocarbon network is a mixture of artificial hydrocarbon compounds (see Fig 2), each one obtained using a chemical-based metaheuristic rule.
0.085034 - The training algorithm is known as the AHN-algorithm (Ponce et al., 2013; 2014b), and it is shown in Algorithm 1; where, ‖R‖ stands for the norm of R, and |A| is the cardinality of set A.

0.072329 - Fuzzy inference system with a molecular approach Fuzzy-molecular inference systems are ensembles of artificial hydrocarbon networks and fuzzy inference systems (Ponce et al., 2013).
0.075000 - For instance, consider a FIS like Fig 1.
0.034722 - As shown, it considers three steps: fuzzification, fuzzy inference engine and defuzzification.
0.062719 - The overall process maps crisp inputs to a fuzzy space and resulting values are returned to as crisp outputs using a molecular approach based on artificial hydrocarbon networks.
0.043210 - In addition, a knowledge base stores information about a specific problem (Ponce et al., 2013).
0.100345 - Fuzzification step In this step, the fuzzy-molecular inference system receives an input x, known as a linguistic variable, and it is mapped to a fuzzy value in the range of [0, 1].
0.092865 - Then, let F be a fuzzy set and μF(x) the membership function of F, ∀x ∈ X; where X is the input domain space.
0.083333 - Moreover, μF(x) ∈ [0, 1] is a real value representing the degree of belonging x to the fuzzy set F as shown in (5) (Ponce et al., 2013).
0.055556 - (5) In addition, x can be partitioned into k different fuzzy sets Fi, for all .
0.083333 - Then, its membership value is calculated over the set of membership functions for all (Ponce et al., 2013).
0.032258 - To this end, the shape of these membership functions depends on the purpose of the problem domain, e.g.
0.000000 - triangular functions.
0.068376 - Fuzzy inference engine step It is a mechanism that computes the consequent value yp of a set of fuzzy rules that accept membership values of linguistic variables.
0.041711 - For instance, let Rp be the pth fuzzy rule of the form as (6); where, is the set of linguistic variables at the antecendents, is the set of fuzzy partitions of the input space X, yp is the variable of the consequent in the pth rule, Mj is the jth CH-molecule of an artificial hydrocarbon network stimulated with the resulting fuzzy implication value (see below), and Δ is any T-norm function (Ponce et al., 2013).
0.055556 - (6) If assuming that is the result of any T-norm function, then (6) can be rewritten as (7); where, φj is the molecular behavior of Mj.
0.077381 - For simplicity to this work, let assume that is the minimum function like expressed in (8).
0.000000 - (7) (8) 2.2.3.
0.050000 - Defuzzification step In this step, it calculates the crisp output value y using centroid defuzzification (9) with all fuzzy rules of the form as (7); where, is the fuzzy evaluation of the antecedents and yp is the pth consequent value, for all fuzzy rules (Ponce et al., 2013).
0.000000 - (9) 2.2.4.
0.063320 - Knowledge base At last, fuzzy-molecular inference systems enclose in the knowledge base specific information about the problem that the fuzzy inference engine step uses.
0.071429 - This knowledge base can be represented as a matrix structure summarizing all fuzzy rules in the system and relating them with molecular outputs.
0.000000 - This matrix can be constructed as suggested by Ponce et al.
0.055556 - (2013)2014b): (i) generate all possible combinations of input variables using the labels of each set in the fuzzy partition of inputs, covering all the fuzzy rules, and (ii) for each combination, assign the corresponding label of molecule Mj that will act when the fuzzy rule is fired.
0.145174 - This section describes the proposal about designing a liquid-level controller at the second tank in coupled-tanks systems using the fuzzy-molecular inference system.
0.095527 - For instance, consider the system shown in Fig 3, in which particularly, La represents the actual liquid level L at the second tank.
0.044715 - If Lr represents the liquid-level reference value, then it can be computed the error over time e(t) between the reference and the actual values like in (10).
0.162594 - (10) On the other hand, Fig 4 shows the block diagram of a liquid level control system for coupled-tanks systems.
0.086667 - As noticed, this is a closed-loop system that occupies the reference value Lr and the actual liquid-level value La to compute the error e(t), which it is used as an input of the control law.
0.050926 - Once the control law generates the correction signal u(t), it sets the pump of the plant (see Fig 3) that will modify La.
0.083791 - To this end, the next section describes the control law using the fuzzy-molecular inference system.

0.142094 - Block diagram of the closed-loop liquid-level control system of coupled-tanks systems.
0.130319 - Design of the control law The FMI-based liquid level controller for coupled-tanks systems requires the design of the control law that will consist of four components, as observed in Fig 1.
0.058824 - Following, each component is described.
0.095696 - Fuzzification step In order to design a FMI-based controller, a control strategy should be selected.
0.060786 - The most common strategies in control theory are: the proportional (P) controller; the proportional and derivative (PD) controller; the proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controller; and the proportional and integral (PI) controller.
0.050725 - In any case, the error e(t) shown in (10) between the reference Lr and actual La liquid level values is required, as well as its derivative and/or its integral ∫e(t)dt.
0.104167 - Other controllers require the derivative and/or integral of a suitable variable.
0.078014 - Once a control strategy has chosen and the inputs of the controller have been selected, this step considers partitioning the input space into k fuzzy sets with its corresponding membership functions for each input x.
0.077236 - As an example, if a P-controller was selected, then the only input is e(t), and it can be partitioned into three fuzzy sets: “negative”, “zero”, and “positive”.
0.060606 - Fuzzy inference engine step At this step, it is required to define the set of fuzzy rules of the form as (7) trying to cover the overall state space of the problem.
0.058140 - Recalling (7), the consequent values yp are computed using the behavioral function (1) of the CH-molecule specified in fuzzy rules (for more details about molecules, see the next defuzzification step).
0.104167 - Thus, the set of fuzzy rules is equivalent to the knowledge base.
0.052381 - As an example of this step, consider the set of rules in (11); then, the knowledge base can be summarized as Table 1.

0.058816 - Defuzzification step The last step in the FMI-based controller computes the correction signal u(t) in order to manipulate the proper actuators (e.g.
0.064103 - the water pump) in the plant such that the liquid level La is regulated.
0.027778 - In fact, the correction signal can be evaluated using (9) such that .
0.037879 - On the other hand, the design of the set of molecules employed in fuzzy rules should be arranged in an artificial hydrocarbon compound like the saturated linear chain of molecules in (2).
0.038462 - In that sense, the design of defuzzification step considers to propose the number of molecules n in the compound, the set of hydrogen Hi and carbon σ values, and the set of bounds Lt of each CH-molecule in the compound.
0.054348 - In Fig 5, it shows an example of an artificial hydrocarbon compound presented as a structural formula (Ponce et al., 2014b), that represents the set of molecules M1, M2, M3 required in Table 1.

0.143773 - For experimental purposes, this controller was developed and implemented for the CE105 TecQuipment coupled-tanks system.
0.136415 - In that sense, the latter system is also introduced, and a model identification was performed to run a comparative experiment between a conventional PID controller and the proposed FMI-based controller.
0.117889 - Lastly, a comparative analysis between a non-conventional quantitative feedback theory (QFT) based controller and the proposed FMI-based controller is also presented and discussed.
0.069170 - System description The CE105 TecQuipment coupled-tanks system used in the case study comprises two separate vertical tanks (i.e., primary and secondary), which they are connected by a flow channel (see Fig 3).
0.075269 - The liquid input is supplied into the primary tank by a variable speed water pump that regulates the inflow.
0.086763 - The intermediate channel allows a relative flow discharge from the primary to the secondary tank, regulated by valve-A.
0.030303 - At last, liquids flow out the reservoir through valve-C.
0.104938 - This system also contains valve-B which allows a flow discharge of the primary tank.
0.000000 - To this end, valves can be manually varying from 0 (totally closed) to 5 (totally opened).
0.122619 - Each tank is fitted with a liquid level sensor mounted at the rear of the CE105 front panel.
0.113553 - Both sensors are individually connected with a flexible tubing located at the base of the tanks.
0.081081 - In addition, an in-line flow sensor is located near to the output of the water pump for measuring the flow rate at this point.
0.045455 - Table 2 summarizes the technical specifications of the CE105 system related to the experiment (Bastida, Ponce, Ramirez, & Molina, 2013; TecQuipment, 2013).
0.109094 - Lastly, the proposed fuzzy-molecular controller will be programmed in the LabVIEW platform hosted in a computer interfaced with the coupled-tanks system using a data-acquisition target NI-DAQ 6009.

0.167659 - Design of the fuzzy-molecular liquid level controller The fuzzy-molecular liquid level controller for the CE105 TecQuipment coupled-tanks system is designed using the methodology described in Section 3.
0.115504 - As already said, conventional controllers for coupled-tanks systems have weaknesses when the dynamics of the system falls out the operating point, resulting in an unstable performance (Abbas et al., 2012; Liang, 2011).
0.129545 - Thus, the proposed fuzzy-molecular controller has to be robust.
0.067376 - Particularly to this case study, the controller will be considered robust if it can respond to any discharge level of valve-C: level 2 (mid-close), level 3 (mid-open) and level 4 (almost-open).
0.105795 - In that sense, a fuzzy-molecular PD controller is proposed with two inputs: the error function e(t) between the liquid-level reference value Lr(t) and the actual liquid-level value La(t), and the change in the actual liquid-level defined as (14).
0.053763 - (14) Then, the input domain space is partitioned into three fuzzy sets: “negative” (N), “zero” (Z) and “positive” (P).
