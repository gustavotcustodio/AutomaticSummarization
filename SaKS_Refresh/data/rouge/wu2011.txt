Tumor markers were measured in 50 patients with lung cancer and 40 patients with benign diseases. Most valuable biomarkers are selected and grouped through multiple logistic regressions analysis. The optimal marker group-coupled ANN model was employed as an intelligent diagnosis system. This system has a diagnosis specificity of 100.0% and diagnosis accuracy 92.8%. The ANN-based system provides a rapid and accurate diagnosis tool for lung cancer.

0.091198 - Background Epidemiological statistics has shown that there are approximately 1.2 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed every year and the death rate of these patients is 17.8%.
0.073563 - Earlier diagnosis is key to promote the five-year survival rate of these cancer patients.
0.133684 - Some tumor markers have been found to be valuable for earlier diagnosis, but a single marker has limitation in its sensitivity and specificity of cancer diagnosis.
0.105653 - To improve the efficiency of diagnosis, several distinct tumor marker groups are combined together using a mathematical evaluation model, called artificial neural network (ANN).
0.066930 - Lung cancer markers have been identified to include carcinoembryonic antigen, carcinoma antigen 125, neuron specific enolase, β2-microglobulin, gastrin, soluble interleukin-6 receptor, sialic acid, pseudouridine, nitric oxide, and some metal ions.
0.189610 - Methods These tumor markers were measured through distinct experimental procedures in 50 patients with lung cancer, 40 patients with benign lung diseases, and 50 cases for a normal control group.

0.284127 - Conclusions The ANN-based system may provide a rapid and accurate diagnosis tool for lung cancer.
0.087018 - Lung cancer is one of the most commonly occurring malignant tumors in the world, and especially in the China (Chinese report of Smoking and Health, 2006).
0.085359 - Epidemiology has revealed that there are approximately 1.2 million new cases of lung cancer diagnosed every year and the death rate of these malignant patients is 17.8% (Strauss, Dominioni, & Jett, 2005).
0.088167 - In fact, the rate of correct diagnosis is relatively low because during the early stage of lung cancer the patients do not have specific symptoms that are recognized by physicians.
0.075000 - However, some tumor biomarkers become present in the blood, urine or tissue of these pre-clinical cancer patients.
0.106205 - Thus, there is sufficient evidence for the use of tumor markers for the diagnosis of cancer, staging, monitoring of treatment response and follow-up in specific patient populations (Li, 2000).
0.041720 - Accumulating evidence has suggested more than one hundred tumor markers (Wang, Zhang, Cui, & Jiang, 2005).
0.079590 - For example, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is a glycoprotein produced by a number of tissues with malignant tumours and benign diseases and it is measured to become present and increases in the circulating blood of cancer patients (Sugarbaker, 1985).
0.060794 - Carcinoma antigen 125 (CA125) was initially identified as an ovarian cancer-associated antigen, but it was later detected in non-small cell lung cancer (Diez et al., 1995).
0.039216 - It has, however, been shown that CA125 possesses low diagnosis sensitivity, ranging from 34% to 62% (Diez et al., 1994).
0.104916 - Progastrin-releasing peptide and neuron specific enolase (NSE) were suggested as two biomarkers for the malignancy of small cell lung cancer (Cho, 2007).
0.083774 - A significantly high concentration of pseudouridine, a degradative product of transfer ribonucleic acid, was found in the urine of patients with lung cancers, when compared to either those patients with pulmonary infectious diseases or healthy controls (Tamura, Fujii, Nakano, Hada, & Higashino, 1986).
0.084720 - Sialic acid in blood may be regarded as a useful marker for a variety of cancers, but its diagnosis specificity is relatively low (Paszkowska, Berbeć, & Cybulski, 1997).
0.061556 - Although the role of the soluble form of interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) is unclear, an increase in the amount of this receptor was observed in various malignant diseases, including lung cancer (Hoheisel et al., 1998).
0.080700 - In addition, it has been shown that an increase in serum levels of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) ions, and their concentration ratio ([Cu2+]/[Zn2+]) are positively correlated with the malignant degree of lung cancer (Ferrigno, Buccheri, & Camilla, 1999).
0.129487 - Most of these tumor markers are however inefficient in diagnosing lung cancers.
0.074169 - No tumor marker is ideal by the strict definition that it is easily and reproducibly measured only in cancer patients and also that its value correlates with either the pathology stages or the patient response to clinical treatment (Healthcar, 2005).
0.113821 - This is based on the fact that a single marker has limitation in sensitivity and specificity and does not satisfy the requirement for fast and correct diagnosis.
0.216179 - To improve the correct rate of diagnosis for lung cancer, some valuable tumor markers were optimally selected and grouped through multiple logistic regressions (MLR).
0.054237 - The latter is a commonly accepted statistical approach to assess association between an antecedent characteristic (i.e., risk factor) and a quantal outcome (i.e., probability of disease occurrence), and to adjust for potential confounding effects of other covariates (Li, Gao, & Qian, 1996; Lee, 1986).
0.103088 - The MLR thus provides a statistical model to test whether such marker factors associate with cancer diagnosis (Fan et al., 2006).
0.125621 - The most valuable of 12 tumor markers were selected into an optimal group by using the MLR.
0.077419 - The correlation of each of these markers with the malignant disease was also established in this study.
0.060000 - Interestingly, it is clear that a mathematical model, called artificial neural network (ANN), is constructed on the basis of a biological neural network system (An, 2001).
0.190667 - We have combined both the ANN and MLR to develop an intelligent diagnosis system, called the optimal tumor marker group-coupled ANN, so as to improve the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of diagnosis for lung cancer.

0.074137 - Twenty of these fifty cases were small cell lung cancer, and the remaining 30 cases were non small cell lung cancer including 12 cases of squamous cell cancers and 18 cases of adenocarcinoma.
0.050667 - They were also classified according to the histological criteria recommended by the World Health Organization; the number of cases that were identified for the TNM stage II, III and IV are 16, 16 and 18, respectively.

0.050794 - Schematic representation of a typical ANN structure.
0.102206 - The ANN consists of three layers of nodes; they are an input layer, a hidden layer and output layer, respectively.

0.029630 - The outputs of the hidden layer nodes are given by weighted sum, Oj = f(ΣOiWji), after transformed by some function, f(x).
0.044444 - The weights connecting the bias nodes to the next layer of nodes are automatically adjusted during the training process to permit incorporation of non-zero intercepts into neural network diagnosis models.
0.041667 - When the number of neurons in hidden layer was 3, the minimum standard error of prediction was obtained.
0.029630 - Subsequently, we investigated whether the training speed influences the standard error of prediction.
0.062963 - It was shown that there was a little difference between 0.5 and 2.0, but this difference could affect convergence speed.

0.073684 - Selection of the training and test subset samples One hundred from 140 samples were randomly selected as a training subset of the neural network.
0.130833 - These samples included 35 normal people, 30 patients with benign lung diseases and 35 patients with lung cancers.
0.126869 - An additional 40 samples were collected from 15 normal people, 10 patients with benign lung diseases and 15 with lung cancer.

0.061728 - By contrast, most of the benign samples (Discriminating results of three groups in the training subset) ranged between 0.4 and 0.6, but two samples are smaller than 0.4 whereas additional two samples are greater than 0.6.
0.057576 - The actual outputs of the normal samples (Discriminating results of three groups in the training subset) are almost smaller than 0.3, with an only exception that exceeds 0.3.

0.072727 - 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 12) of the normal samples (Predictive results for three groups in the examining subset) were misjudged as the benign type in the test subset.
0.115729 - Effects of different marker numbers on the output of their group-based ANN It is unclear whether different numbers of tumor makers influence the ANN-based diagnosis of lung cancer.
0.077028 - We tried to choose four and three from the above six tumor markers according to the stepwise regression procedure.
0.085470 - For example, a group consisted of four tumor makers CEA, [Cu2+]/[Zn2+], sialic acid, and [Ca2+], the former three of which comprised an additional group.
0.064368 - The structure and parameters of the corresponding neural network were similar to those described above.
0.085714 - The rates of discrimination and prediction were formulated and are shown in Table 5.
0.062540 - These results indicate that either discrimination or prediction rates vary with the number of tumor markers.
0.067033 - These two rates could gradually be improved by increasing the number of tumor markers.
0.071429 - As anticipated, the group including twelve tumor markers is the best one among these groups tested.
0.055773 - It is notable however that no significant difference is observed in the two groups comprising six or twelve tumor markers (Table 5).
0.081319 - This suggests that an optimal group of six tumor markers may satisfy clinical demands.

0.045277 - Comparison of the neural network with the traditional statistical method The normal values of tumor markers may be derived by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (Kang, 1999), in which the point for the highest sensitivity but the lowest false positive rate can be found.
0.084444 - The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated according to the following formula 8–10 (Li, 1998).
0.099509 - The optimal group of six tumor markers was dealt with either ANN or the traditional metric medical statistical method (Table 6).
0.114493 - Our results indicate that the ANN-based diagnosis is superior to the traditional method, because specificity has remarkably improved from 72.0% to 100.0% and accuracy increased from 71.4% to 92.8%.

0.109668 - The value of a single tumor marker is limited in diagnosing lung cancer, and therefore it is advisable to combine several markers that have complementary sensitivities (Zhao et al., 2005).
0.068148 - In the quantitative determination, sensitivity is not consistent with the specificity; there exists a trade-off relationship between sensitivity and specificity because they often vary with the critical values (Wu, 2002).
0.040317 - The optimal critical value can usually be chosen using the ROC curve (Ren et al., 2000).
0.030556 - The vertical axis of ROC is expressed by true positive rate as the sensitivity, whereas its horizontal axis is shown by false positive rate (which is equal to 100% minus the value of specificity).
0.071429 - Different critical values of the ROC can reflect the changes between sensitivity and specificity.
0.064593 - Therefore, the critical value of tumor markers is often evaluated by the ROC.
0.043678 - From this it is deduced that the normal critical values of CEA, [Cu2+/Zn2+], sialic acid, [Ca2+], gastrin and NSE are 20 μg L-1, 1.0, 1040 mg L-1, 100 mg L-1, 95 ng L-1, 18 μg L-1, respectively.
0.088023 - Combinative determination of all these six tumor markers indicated that the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy are 98.0% (49/50), 72.0% (36/50), and 71.4% (100/140), respectively.
0.100556 - The sensitivity for 6 markers of lung cancer combined is higher than that obtained from a single marker.
0.094642 - By contrast, specificity of the six-marker combinative determination is to varying degrees reduced, and its accuracy is relatively lower than that for a single tumor marker.
0.063768 - This problem has been solved by an ANN technology.
0.072612 - Although a lot of algorithms for the ANN have been developed, the back-propagation algorithm is widely used in various areas.
0.068817 - However, the back-propagation algorithm has some disadvantages, such as easily local minimization and slow convergence rate.
0.022764 - Thus, some scientists use an improved algorithm by including the item of the momentum; it can effectively accelerate convergence to prevent from oscillating (Zhang, Wu, & Wu, 2007).
0.055556 - We have selected a momentum coefficient to be 0.95.
0.082906 - The ANN-based approach is superior to a traditional medical statistical method.
0.071429 - It is because ANN can identify the trends and features of relatively complex information.
0.053333 - This network can also act as a pattern processor by two phases in the information processing.
0.129293 - We have developed an intelligence system for diagnosing lung cancers.
0.108571 - Our results demonstrated that the diagnosis specificity was remarkably improved from 72.0% to 100.0%, and the accuracy was also increased from 71.4% to 92.8%.
0.141158 - While the ANN-based system can also distinguish between benign lung diseases and normal people with a total accuracy rate of 91.1%.
0.136675 - However, lack of discrimination between benign lung diseases and normal group suggest that the optimal tumor marker group-based ANN diagnosis system is neither specific nor sensitive enough to distinguish these two groups.
0.137967 - This is because the optimal tumor marker group was selected to primarily distinguish lung cancer from either benign lung diseases or normal control.
0.088081 - In summary, we have proved that the measurement combination of a tumor marker group is more powerful than a single marker.
0.133992 - Mathematical evaluation of a tumor marker profile employing ANN modeling has demonstrated that the optimal tumor maker group can improve the efficiency of tumor markers applied in the diagnosis of lung cancer.
0.155946 - The set-up of this ANN-based system is useful to extensively survey the high-risk group and also to screen patients with either lung cancer or benign disease.
0.128790 - Thus, this system will play a positive role in cancer detection and prevention.

[Frase 34] We have combined both the ANN and MLR to develop an intelligent diagnosis system, called the optimal tumor marker group-coupled ANN, so as to improve the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of diagnosis for lung cancer.
[Frase 8] The optimal marker group-coupled ANN model was employed as an intelligent diagnosis system.
[Frase 190] Mathematical evaluation of a tumor marker profile employing ANN modeling has demonstrated that the optimal tumor maker group can improve the efficiency of tumor markers applied in the diagnosis of lung cancer.
