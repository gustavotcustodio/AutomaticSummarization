In this study we show heart rate variability which can be used as a passive means to quantify drowsiness. Frequency domain components of HRV is used for early detection of fatigue. We also designed a neural network based artificial intelligent algorithm which detects whether the given HRV signal is in alert of fatigue state. The frequency domain components of HRV were also used to distinguish between parasympathetic (HF) and sympathetic (LF) activities using LF/HF ratio. Statistical analysis was also performed to identify the difference between LF/HF ratio during alert and fatigue states.

0.095238 - It is defined as the measure of variation in heart beats and is calculated by analyzing the time series of beat to beat intervals (i.e., the R–R intervals) (Institute of HeartMath, 2007).
0.100915 - HRV has been previously used to examine mental workload (Hancock & Verwey, 1997), stress (Bornas et al., 2004; Steyvers & De Waards, 2000), and driver fatigue (Egelund, 1982).
0.130631 - In relation to driver fatigue, HRV can provide useful data of when fatigue becomes an issue during driving.
0.091020 - An increase in HRV is an indication of decrease in mental workload, which can occur in sleepy drivers over prolonged monotonous driving (Horne & Reyner, 1995).
0.084714 - But lower workload may also be related to lower vigilance, which can negatively impact driver performance.

0.090280 - This band pass filter was designed to attenuate all the frequencies below 2 Hz and beyond 40 Hz.
0.069530 - By doing so most of the noise recorded due to muscle movements, 50-Hz powerline, baseline wanders and T-wave interference is attenuated.
0.065728 - The filtered data is then passed through a squaring function which is a non-linear operation.
0.084715 - Through this operation all the data points becomes positive and it further amplifies the higher frequencies in the signal which are mainly due to the QRS complex (Tompkins, 1993).
0.089157 - The R–R peaks were detected from the squared heart rate time series using a threshold value such that all the data points above the threshold value were reduced to the threshold value and all the data points below the threshold value were reduced to zero.
0.098958 - To further get rid of any artifact which might have crept in during ECG recording, the algorithm was further enhanced such that once a data point greater than the threshold value (which is a peak of QRS) is detected then all the data points for next 350 ms is reduced to zero (Tompkins, 1993).

0.106496 - Our neural network was designed using a feed-forward network in which signals, travel one way only, from inputs nodes to output nodes.
0.066667 - There is no feedback, that is, the output of any layer does not affect the output of the same layer (Nguyen, 2006).
0.101348 - Training the neural network is another important criterion which should be considered while designing the neural network.
0.089341 - We used supervised learning mode for training the neural network as the desired output called targets are provided by the trainer.
0.065217 - It involves repeated exposure to training data and iterative modification of the weights that are set to random values, until the model learns to perform the task properly (Smarasinghe, 2007).
0.108983 - Various learning rules like delta learning rule, and widrow-hoff learning rule can be used to train the neural network (Nguyen, 2006).
0.099183 - These learning rules tend to change the value of weights connecting the neurons which is in proportion to how strongly one neuron excites the other (Smarasinghe, 2007).
0.113013 - Different activation functions like threshold logic unit (TLU), logistic function (LF), bipolar logistic function (BLF), and hyperbolic tangent function (HTF) can be used while designing a neural network.
0.118230 - Activation functions also known as threshold neurons are used in neural network which transforms the output from the neuron to produce a 1 or 0 (Fig 3).
0.081818 - This output is compared with the target output and if the classification result is wrong, than the learning algorithm adjusts the weights to map the input data correctly to one of the two classes that is, a 1 or 0 (Smarasinghe, 2007).
0.131582 - The above combination can be used for designing a single layer neural network or multiple layer neural networks.

0.222711 - Statistical analysis To identify a difference between LF/HF ratio during alert and fatigue states nonparametric analysis was performed using a dependent sample Wilcoxon matched pairs test.
0.176050 - The mean and standard deviation of LF/HF ratio for alert state was (1.7 ± 1.1) and that of fatigue state was (1.2 ± 0.9).
0.131192 - LF/HF ratio was significantly lower during fatigue as compared to the alert state (T = 8.0, Z = 2.4, p = 0.01).
0.202304 - This study examined the use of HRV and neural network to detect fatigue in drivers.
0.084250 - The accuracy of the neural network was substantially high at 90%.
0.123803 - As we had a limited amount of data set the accuracy of the neural network cannot be validated entirely.
0.085586 - In order to validate the accuracy we need to have more data sets for training, validating and testing.
0.125313 - The HRV spectrum analysis gives a direct relationship between fatigue and the HRV.
0.085561 - Egelund (1982) has also reported that there were significant association between the distance driven by the driver and HRV in the region 0.05–0.15 Hz (0.1 Hz HRV).
0.112145 - As the HRV is analyzed over a range of 5 min the lower bands of the HRV spectrum the ULF and VLF does not have any importance and hence the analysis of these frequencies should be avoided over the short term recording (European Heart Journal, 1996).
0.112360 - The distribution of power and the central frequency of LF and HF are not fixed but may vary in relation to changes in autonomic modulations of heart period.
0.112329 - Decreases in the LF/HF state has been previously related to a more drowsy state (Byeon, Hans, Min, Wo, & Park, 2006), while increases in LF/HF tend to indicate greater mental workload or alertness (Sato, Kamada, Miyake, Kumashiro, & Kume, 1998).
0.122002 - As stated in Table 2 it was observed that the LF/HF ratio decreased with increase in fatigue.
0.100251 - This is indicative of a decline in driving control and performance in drivers.
0.121776 - Hence LF/HF ratio could serve as an indicator of fatigue.
0.138526 - Neural network which provided an accuracy of 90% was derived only on the basis of HRV analysis.
0.126505 - The accuracy of neural network can be improved in different ways.

0.110599 - This will provide the neural network with sufficient learning on different variations in HRV and hence would further increase the accuracy of the neural network.
0.108188 - Architecture of neural network also plays an important role in the accuracy of the neural network.
0.094748 - The present neural network was designed using a single layer network.

0.083333 - Research to detect fatigue using different human physiology has been conducted previously (Brown, 1994; Lal et al., 2003; Ying, Jing, & Zhou, 2007).
0.000000 - Artaud et al.
0.130563 - in 1994 used the driver’s breathing regularity as a prediction to fatigue.
0.134122 - EEG has proved to be a useful human physiological measure to detect fatigue but electrodes need to be mounted on the scalp of the drivers.
0.128327 - External tools like video recording of driver’s face can be used to detect fatigue but its feasibility is unknown even though many systems are available.
0.200096 - The findings of this study suggests that HRV which provides a measurable physiological signature of fatigue during driving, can be used along with neural network or any other artificial intelligence systems for development of in-vehicle alerting and warning devices.
0.159671 - Therefore, HRV may be used for developing fatigue countermeasures in order reduce the detrimental effects of fatigue upon driving.
0.050125 - Further studies are required to confirm the above findings with larger sample size.
