0.035088 - Experiment design, comparison and discussion are in Section 5.
0.000000 - We conclude this paper with future work in Section 6.
0.040000 - In FJSP, each job consists of a sequence of operations.
0.042667 - An operation can be executed by one machine out of a set of candidate machines.
0.022222 - Each operation of a job must be processed only on one machine at a time, while each machine can process only one operation at a time.
0.090909 - The following notations and assumptions are used for the formulation of FJSP.
0.057143 - (1) Let , indexed , be a set of jobs to be scheduled.
0.031373 - denotes total number of operations of job .
0.044444 - (2) Let , indexed , be a set of machines.
0.040000 - (3) Each job consists of a predetermined sequence of operations.
0.038095 - Let be operation of .
0.030769 - (4) Each operation can be processed without interruption on one of a set of candidate machines .
0.051852 - Let be the processing time of on machine .
0.059069 - (5) Decision variables denotes the completion time of the operation ; denotes the completion time of the job (6) The objective is to minimize makespan.
0.000000 - Makespan denoted by , can be calculated by formula (1).
0.096296 - (1) where is the complete time of job .
0.110145 - Makespan is related to completion time of all jobs and the machine efficiency.
0.076923 - If makespan value is reduced, it can shorten the job completion time and improve machine efficiency.
0.053333 - In remanufacturing environment, the arrival time of new job is unpredictable (Guide, Jayaraman, & Srivastava, 1999; Guide, 2000; MurisLage & Moacir, 2012).
0.098095 - When a new job arrives and needs to be inserted into the already scheduled job sequence, re-scheduling is needed.
0.098095 - Because there is a scheduled scheme processing, the machines are available for re-scheduling when the corresponding operations are completed.
0.039394 - It means that jobs on machines may have different start times after re-scheduling.
0.142593 - There are three different re-scheduling strategies proposed.
0.093333 - (1) Strategy I is to reschedule the new job(s).
0.071111 - Existing scheduling scheme is remained.
0.082906 - In this re-scheduling strategy, the machines are available when all the assigned operations are completed.
0.067172 - It means that machines may have different start time when re-scheduling is implemented.
0.064320 - Hence, machine start time must be considered for re-scheduling in this strategy.
0.070510 - The re-scheduling problem becomes FJSP with different machine starting times.
0.103522 - (2) Strategy II is to re-schedule both new job(s) and the existing jobs’ operations that are no started yet.
0.053333 - The revised schedule for existing jobs’ operations may be changed.
0.040000 - Consider a scenario that some machines may be processing some operations of existing jobs at the new job inserting time.
0.040000 - The machines are available when the processing operations are completed.
0.080464 - The existing jobs are also available for re-scheduling when the corresponding operations are completed.
0.047985 - It means that maybe jobs have different start time and machines have different available time after re-scheduling.
0.067033 - Hence, both machine start time and job start time must be considered for re-scheduling in this strategy.
0.074469 - The re-scheduling problem becomes to FJSP with different machine starting times and different job starting times.
0.078283 - (3) Strategy III is available-time-block re-scheduling based on existing scheduling scheme.
0.088889 - Similar to Strategy I, the existing scheduling schema is also remained.
0.053333 - The new job(s) are scheduled on all gaps of all machines after inserting time.
0.057143 - It means that one machine is available if it has free-time-gap on the existing scheduling schema.
0.023188 - In this condition, this machine can be employed for scheduling new job(s).
0.066944 - After considered all available-time-block on each machine, the same scheduling strategy in Strategy I is employed to schedule remaining operations.
0.040000 - Compared to Strategy I, Strategy III has higher time complexity.
0.102857 - To explain FJSP problem and the three different re-scheduling strategies more clearly, two examples are shown in following content.
0.042667 - Fig 1(a) shows a Gantt chart for 3-jobs and 3-machines FJSP problem.
0.068966 - The numbers of operations in three jobs are Job 1, 3, Job 2, 2 and Job 3, 2, respectively.
0.077193 - The makespan value in this scheduling solution is 10.
0.100000 - The completion time of three machines is M1, 8, M2, 7 and M3, 10.
0.034286 - Fig 1(b) shows the new job, Job 4, arrives at time 3 and will be inserted into existing schedule at or after time 3.
0.050000 - The Job 4 has three operations.
0.078283 - Fig 1(c) and (d) show re-scheduling scheme using strategy I and II.
0.066667 - In Fig 1(c), existing scheduling scheme is remained and the Job 4 are scheduled when the assigned operation on all machines are completed.
0.113975 - The start times of three machines for re-scheduling are M1, 8, M2, 7 and M3, 10.
0.050575 - In Fig 1(d), both new Job 4 and all no start operations of existing three jobs are rescheduled.
0.070588 - The available time of M1 and M3 is 3 while the available time of Job 2, Job 3 and Job 4 is also 3.
0.069136 - M2 is processing the first operation of Job 1 when the Job 4 inserts at Time 3.
0.085333 - M2 and Job 1 are available when the first operation of Job 1 is completed.
0.090909 - Therefore, the available time of M2 and Job 1 is Time 4.
0.048485 - In Fig 1(d), the start time of Operation 1.2 and Operation 1.3 are delayed than that in Fig 1(b).
0.066667 - Fig 1(e) and (f) show the Strategy III for another example.
0.028986 - New job 5 comes and inserts into existing scheduling schema at Time 4.
0.055914 - In Fig 1(f), the operation 5.1 and 5.2 are assigned at free gap of machine M2 and M3.

0.109524 - ABC algorithm is a population-based meta-heuristic proposed by Karaboga (Karaboga, 2005, 2009; Karaboga and Basturk, 2008).
0.106667 - ABC is inspired from the foraging behavior of bee colony.
0.074074 - There are three kinds of bees, namely, employed bees, onlooker bees and scout bees in ABC algorithm.
0.050000 - A bee that is currently exploiting a food source is called an employed bee.
0.064368 - A bee waiting in the hive for making decision to choose a food source is named as an onlooker.
0.056410 - A bee carrying out a random search for a new food source is called a scout.
0.065142 - Each solution to the problem under consideration is called a food source, whereas the fitness of the solution is corresponded to the nectar amount of the associated food resource.
0.095906 - The main steps of the basic ABC algorithm are as followings.
0.078393 - (1) Initialization of the parameters and population phase The parameter of ABC are the number of food sources ( ), the number of trials after which a food source is to be abandoned (limit) and the termination criterion.
0.082051 - The number of food sources is equal to the number of employed bees or onlooker bees.
0.090323 - The initialization of population is to fill the population with number of randomly generated food sources, n-dimensional real-valued vectors.
0.042105 - Let represent the ith food source in the population.
0.063333 - The food sources are generated as follows: (2) where is a uniform random number in the range [0, 1]; and are the lower and upper bounds for the dimension respectively.
0.074667 - The food sources are randomly assigned to employed bees and the corresponding finesses are evaluated.
0.045528 - (2) Employed bee phase In this phase, each employed bee generates a new food source in the neighborhood of its present position as follows: (3) where and are randomly chosen indexes.
0.063158 - is a uniformly distributed real number in [−1, 1].
0.038095 - will be compared to .
0.060215 - If the fitness of is equal or better than that of , will replace as a new food source; otherwise is retained.
0.046847 - (3) Onlooker bee phase An onlooker bee evaluates all the employed bees and selects a food source depending on its probability value calculated by the following expression.
0.080464 - (4) where is the nectar amount or the fitness value of the ith food source .
0.055556 - The higher the is, the more ability that the ith food source is selected.
0.061538 - Once the food source is selected, the onlooker bee will execute the update using Eq (3).
0.030476 - If the new food source has equal or better fitness value than , the new food source will replace as a new member in the population.
0.068217 - (4) Scout bee phase If a food source cannot be improved through a predetermined number of trials limit, the food source is to be abandoned and the corresponding employed bee becomes a scout.
0.050000 - The scout produces a new food source randomly as follows: (5) where is a uniform random number in the range [0, 1].
0.063158 - (5) Repeat (2)–(4) until the termination is satisfied.
0.061723 - Encoding and decoding A solution in this paper consists of two vectors corresponding to the machine assignment and operation scheduling sub-problems of the FJSP with new job inserting.
0.074510 - Using ABC algorithm, a bee is therefore composed of two parts, Machine Assignment vector (hereafter called MA) and Operation Sequencing vector (hereafter called OS).
0.058333 - MA is a sequence for assigning machine for each operation while OS is a sequence for ordering the operations on selected machines.
0.027586 - Fig 2(a) illustrates a machine assignment vector (MA) while Fig 2(b) shows the corresponding operation sequence (OS).
0.095238 - In Fig 2(a), the first line is the operation of all jobs while the second line is the MA used in the proposed algorithm.
0.036364 - In MA, each element represents the machine selected for the corresponding operation.
0.058667 - For example, the first value “3” means machine 3 is selected for processing operation O11.
0.052726 - In OS, the same elements represent the different operations of the same job.
0.081159 - For example, the first value “2” is the first operation of job 2.
0.082540 - The second value “1” is the first operation of job 1.
0.082540 - The third value “3” is the first operation of job 3.
0.054167 - The fourth value “2” represents the second operation of job 2 because it is the second time value “2” appearing in OS.
0.050450 - In the same way, the fifth value “4” is the first operation of job 4 while the sixth value “4” represents the second operation of job 4.
0.056566 - The seventh value “1” is the second operation of job 1 while the eighth value “3” represents the second operation of job 3.
0.037333 - The last four values “2, 4, 3, 1” represent the third operations of corresponding jobs.
0.062745 - Illustration of MA and OS Fig 2.
0.071111 - Illustration of MA and OS.
0.042667 - Pinedo (2002) divided schedules into three classes: non-delay schedule, active schedule and semi-schedule.
0.032000 - It has been verified in the above literature that active schedule contains the optimal schedule.
0.072381 - In an active schedule, there is no operation to be processed earlier except putting off other operations start time or changing the order of operations.
0.052381 - Therefore, we decode the MAOS solution to be an active schedule in order to reduce the search space.
0.066667 - The criterion for obtaining the active schedule is to find the earliest idle time interval for each operation on the corresponding machine.
0.072222 - The process of finding the earliest idle time interval is shown in Fig 3.
0.053901 - Therefore, in the two-stage ABC algorithm, a bee includes two parts: one part is the machine assignment that is the machine permutation and another is the operation sequence that is the job permutation (see Fig 4).
0.053333 - The process of finding the earliest idle time Fig 3.

0.084211 - Proposed crossover operator for MS part of new solution.
0.075556 - Population initialization In meta-heuristics, the quality of initial population often affects the speed of convergence to a satisfactory solution.
0.075362 - Therefore, it is a critical step to generate a better quality initial population.
0.070175 - The initialization process includes MA phase and OS phase.
0.047312 - For MA initialization, random rule and global minimum processing time rule are employed to select one processing machine for each operation.
0.069565 - In addition, a minimum completion time rule is also employed for MA initialization.
0.009524 - In this rule, two machines will be considered for each operation that has more than two selectable machines.
0.018391 - The operation has minimum processing time on machine M1 while the second selected machine M2 has earliest feasible time.
0.060606 - The completion times of this operation on above two machines are compared.
0.032000 - The machine with the smaller completion time will ultimately be selected for processing the operation.
0.048485 - This rule considers the completion time of each operation to makespan optimization.
0.061905 - For OS initialization, random rule, most work remaining rule and most number of operations remaining rule are employed.
0.064000 - All the above initialization methods do machine assignment first, and then perform the operation sequencing.
0.109273 - One initializing rule with reverse process, reverse heuristic (RH), is proposed.
0.051613 - In this heuristic, the operation sequence is decided randomly first, then the machine assignment is decided based on the operation sequence.
0.050000 - The steps of this heuristic are as follows: Step 1: All operations of all jobs are shuffled randomly to obtain operation sequence.
0.040580 - Step 2: Calculate the completion time of each operation on all selectable machines.
0.066667 - The machine with the minimum completion time is selected for processing operation .
0.070175 - Exploitation search According to the characteristic of FJSP with new job inserting and the encoding strategies, we use crossover operators for the OS part of a new solution.
0.075000 - There are several crossover operations proposed during the past decades, such as partial-mapped crossover, order crossover, cycle crossover and so on.
0.011594 - In this study, we employed a new crossover operator based on order crossover.
0.040000 - We obtain two new solutions from the current two solutions.
0.024551 - The proposed crossover operator works for the OS part as follows: Step 1: Generate a random number R from 1 to number of jobs; Step 2: Copy the values from the OS part of S1 to the corresponding positions in New S1 where the values are less than or equal to R.
