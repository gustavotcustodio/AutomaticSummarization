0.024242 - As presented in Fig 5, there are several different sources of raw-materials to produce biodiesel in Brazil.
0.064460 - In recent survey of the PBA the raw materials most used by biodiesel production plant are as follows: soybean oil (78%), animal fat (16%), cotton oil (3%), methanol (63%), and ethanol (29%).
0.060606 - The most used combination of raw materials for biodiesel production in Brazil is therefore soybean oil and methanol.
0.056848 - The choice of suppliers in the biodiesel supply chain has been presented several particularities: (i) the sector is regulated; (ii) it is part of a wider government program in sustainability and social inclusion; and, (iii) there is a great diversity of raw-materials available for production, with different properties, costs, energetic efficiency and production scale.
0.088050 - The lower cost of supplying is only used for supplier selection of biodiesel by ANP through auctions.
0.073830 - However, the biodiesel producer should have the Social Fuel Stamp to participate in auctions, buying 30% of the necessary oil from small family farms (according with the Brazilian Law).
0.059259 - The volume of remaining oil (70% oil) can be acquired from other sources.
0.059259 - It is also necessary an alcohol supply to complete the production of biodiesel.
0.019324 - There are two possibilities as follows: (i) methanol, used worldwide to produce biodiesel; and (ii) ethanol, produced on a large scale in Brazil from sugarcane.
0.053872 - The choice of alcohol is related to the following criteria: cost of supplying; interest in export development; (2) reaction time, the methanol rate is twice than ethanol; and, (3) environmental advantage, the use of ethanol generates an “100% green” biodiesel.
0.084210 - Therefore, to define the set of suppliers in the biodiesel supply chain is a complex task that requires analysis and consideration of several and contrasting criteria, involving economic, technological and social issues, since the lowest cost solution is not applicable due to the long-term relationship with the involved suppliers and the Social Fuel Stamp issue.
0.088161 - The main objective of the experiments is to determine the type of oil to supply for the biodiesel production.
0.061487 - This can be considered one of the most important decisions for a biodiesel plant, since the oil supply is responsible for an estimated 88% of the overall biodiesel production cost (Hass et al., 2006).
0.052288 - Moreover, a “proper” oil supply provides a continuous flow of production, the essence of any SCM.
0.022831 - We evaluated four potential vegetal oil supplying alternatives as follows: soybean oil supplier (SBS), sunflower oil supplier (SFS), canola oil supplier (CS) e castor oil supplier (CBS).
0.110084 - This kind of supplying decision establishes a long-term relationship among the biodiesel plant and their effective suppliers that demands a more careful analysis.
0.000000 - As a consequence, two different contexts were analyzed.
0.051258 - First a decision making process was carried out without considering possible dynamic events that can disturb the decision making process.
0.073324 - Next, some dynamic events were introduced, emphasizing both the learning aspects of the developed method as well as the importance of the architecture presented in Fig 4.
0.070922 - Experiments settings In this section we describe the required parameters to conduct the experiments.
0.060443 - The necessary data were determined based on a review of the prior literature (Demirbas, 2009; Hass et al., 2006; Ho et al., 2010) and semi-structured interviews undertaken with experts from a Brazilian biodiesel production plant, emulating a real-world decision making process.

0.098595 - Fig 6 shows the structuring of the hierarchy of the ID proposed, which includes three levels.
0.100605 - The top level of hierarchy (SupplierPerformance node) represents the ultimate goal of the problem, while the second level consist of three main supplier selection criteria, which are namely economic, technological and social.
0.087432 - At the third level, these criteria were decomposed into various sub-criteria that may affect the choice of a particular supplier.

0.071795 - In this case, we started the simulations without defining the prior probabilities, i.e., the probabilities of Table 3 were initialized to zero.
0.100629 - During the experiments, new evidences were gradually stored in the Database Model by the Supply Chain Simulator.
0.082456 - According to Fig 7, in the first steps of the simulation the suppliers presented the same performance, so the demand of oil was divided proportionately among them.
0.071730 - In the 110th simulation step, the CBS alternative posterior probabilities were updated with new evidence stored in the Database Model during the simulations, getting a performance higher than others alternatives.
0.102517 - The oil demand graph demonstrates the preference change of the biodiesel production plant in relation to the previous simulations steps.
0.095597 - The same situation occurs in the 220th, 330th and 440th simulation steps, demonstrating the preference chance for canola, sunflower and soybean, respectively.
0.033755 - Thus, until the 550th simulation steps, approximately, alternative CBS is preferred to SFS (CBS ≻ SFS), SFS is preferred to CS (SFS ≻ CS) and CS is preferred to CBS (CS ≻ CBS).

0.086943 - Evolution of the alternatives of vegetable oil supplying.
0.033138 - Finally, considering that the production of biodiesel has an important role in social inclusion and the canola was cited by interviews as the most appropriate crop for small family farms, we simulated the following government incentives for canola production from 550th simulation steps onward: (i) subsidies to reduce the production cost and transportation (C22 and C27), (ii) investments in infrastructure (C23 and C24), (iii) increased availability of funding (C27), and (iv) technical training (C34 and C35).
0.073446 - Based on the new data generated by the Supply Chain Simulator, the performance of alternative CS increased to 9.04.
0.042667 - This rating value is obtained when the following changes happens in the criteria values: C22 = A; C23 = A; C24 = EH; C27 = L; C29 = VL; C34 = L; and C35 = L. Therefore, according to the new values calculated, alternative CS is preferred to SBS, CBS is preferred to SFS and SFS is preferred to CBS.
0.128060 - The case study demonstrated that the developed method can be effectively used by biodiesel plants to define the best vegetal oil supplying.
0.098039 - The method can be also used to further determine the best suppliers in each oil category.
0.087054 - However, the model can also be employed by the Brazilian government as an aid in the establishment of policies to stimulate the production of new sources of raw-material.
0.076465 - Nowadays, 78% of the biodiesel production plant of Brazil utilize soybean as main raw-material in the manufacturing process.
0.055016 - However, as this option is related to large producers, it is important to carry out studies to evaluate the best alternatives of production by small family farms, since the biodiesel producers need to purchase their production to maintain the Social Fuel Stamp.
0.039216 - The developed framework presented in Fig 4 can play a vital role in this difficult task.
0.129890 - In this work, we presented a novel method based on the integration of influence diagram and fuzzy logic to rank and evaluate suppliers in a supply chain context.
0.099291 - This approach presents the following advantages: (i) modeling of uncertainty and vagueness of information.
0.124882 - The method uses linguistic variables to assess ratings and weights of criteria; (ii) exploiting probabilistic learning in supplier selection problem through Bayesian learning; (iii) representing explicitly the decision maker’s knowledge in influence diagrams, eliminating redundant criteria, storing historical data about purchasing decision making process, and facilitating the communication of the outcomes of the decision-making process; and (iv) supporting long term relationships with suppliers, incorporating learning and dynamic environmental changes in the customer preferences.
0.094853 - We used the biodiesel supply chain in order to illustrate the main features of the proposed solution.
0.106270 - Notwithstanding the short experimentation time, the tests carried out clearly demonstrate that the developed method has enormous potential as an effective prescriptive tool in real-world supplier selection, particularly in long term relationships.
0.097445 - The method was able to capture dynamic events and to reevaluate preferences to reanalyze the decision making process.
0.070922 - Further tests using quantitative techniques are forthcoming towards assessing the range of its capabilities.
0.118069 - Many areas of our research can be further explored as follows: (i) to develop a graphic interface to assist the decision makers in the design of the influence diagram.
0.096996 - Currently, the construction of the model is made with Hugin® software; (ii) to expand the developed model in order to consider large databases; and (ii) to explore the use of qualitative attributes.

[Frase 274] The method uses linguistic variables to assess ratings and weights of criteria; (ii) exploiting probabilistic learning in supplier selection problem through Bayesian learning; (iii) representing explicitly the decision maker’s knowledge in influence diagrams, eliminating redundant criteria, storing historical data about purchasing decision making process, and facilitating the communication of the outcomes of the decision-making process; and (iv) supporting long term relationships with suppliers, incorporating learning and dynamic environmental changes in the customer preferences.
[Frase 69] This paper contributes to the state-of-art of the supplier selection problem, presenting a novel approach that combines influence diagram (ID) and fuzzy logic to select suppliers, emphasizing the dynamics characteristics of a long-term relationship with suppliers.
[Frase 71] The state of each node of the influence diagram can be represented by linguistic fuzzy variables, allowing to overcome the vagueness and imprecision of the information and reduce the model complexity.
