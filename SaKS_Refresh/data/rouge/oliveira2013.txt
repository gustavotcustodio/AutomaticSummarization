0.087855 - Predicting the direction of stock price changes is an important factor, as it contributes to the development of effective strategies for stock exchange transactions and attracts much interest in incorporating variables historical series into the mathematical models or computer algorithms in order to produce estimations of expected price fluctuations.
0.162509 - The purpose of this study is to build a neural model for the financial market, allowing predictions of stocks closing prices future behavior negotiated in BM&FBOVESPA in the short term, using the economic and financial theory, combining technical analysis, fundamental analysis and analysis of time series, to predict price behavior, addressing the percentage of correct predictions of price series direction (POCID or Prediction of Change in Direction).
0.143332 - The aim of this work is to understand the information available in the financial market and identify the variables that drive stock prices.
0.258824 - The methodology presented may be adapted to other companies and their stock.
0.172680 - Petrobras stock PETR4, traded in BM&FBOVESPA, was used as a case study.
0.136048 - As part of this effort, configurations with different window sizes were designed, and the best performance was achieved with a window size of 3, which the POCID index of correct direction predictions was 93.62% for the test set and 87.50% for a validation set.
0.097496 - The financial market is characterized by uncertainty, which is associated with the expectation of its future status in the short, medium and long terms.
0.087719 - Different prediction techniques have been applied to reduce the uncertainty of such market.
0.098246 - The design of models capable of capturing the market dynamics, aiming to reduce uncertainties, has been the subject matter of research and has attracted the interest of academic researchers and market professionals.
0.104418 - Financial analysts and investors observe the stock market trends in order to conduct purchase and sale transactions, in order to obtain financial return from such transactions.
0.096970 - They analyze the historical prices data and economic indicators for decision making.
0.048346 - Such decisions normally have two stages: firstly, a list of companies is selected based on their growth potential and economic fundamentals performance; secondly, price changes are examined, so that a correct negotiation strategy is executed at the appropriate time (Assaf, 2011; Francis, 1991; Frank & Norton, 2008; Lima, 2008; Matsura, 2007).
0.120986 - In the literature, different methods have been applied to make predictions about the financial market.
0.104187 - Such methods may be grouped into four main categories: (i) Fundamental Analysis, (ii) Technical Analysis (iii) Prediction of Time Series with Traditional Models and (iv) Machine Learning Methods.
0.098595 - The Fundamental Analysis is based on the market economic factors.
0.095890 - Such analysis uses statistics, projections, conditions of supply and demand of goods and services and fundamentals of the economy and enterprise.
0.079344 - Technical Analysts, known as “chartists,” try to predict the market behavior by deriving patterns based on the study of charts that depict historical market data (Assaf, 2011; Francis, 1991; Frank, 2008; Lima, 2008; Matsura, 2007).
0.093834 - The Prediction of time series with traditional models is an attempt to design linear prediction models to track patterns in historical data.
0.042328 - In turn, such linear models are divided into two categories: univariate models and multivariate regression models.
0.052632 - Recently, various methods have been proposed under the same label of machine learning.
0.069959 - Such methods use a set of data samples to draw (linear or nonlinear) patterns so as to approximate the underlying function which generates the data.
0.101695 - Hellstrom and Holmstrom (1998) identified that the stock prices prediction task is not easy.
0.086495 - Within the scope of science, academic researchers are divided into two groups: those who believe that it is possible to design mechanisms to predict the market behavior and those who believe in the efficient market theory, proposed by Fama (1970), according to which the price of stock follows a random (unpredictable) walk.
0.081483 - One of the implications of this theory is that the prediction based on patterns is not possible, since it is not possible for any material to include the same information and for the market to receive it in the same manner (Morettin, 2008; Nayak & Braak, 2007).
0.084746 - According to Póvoa (2008), the efficient markets hypothesis may not be considered “acceptable”.
0.080169 - The market’s practical reality, especially concerning dissemination and interpretation of information, is very different from the hypothesis presented that assume an ideal world.
0.084577 - Nonetheless, the author affirms that the hypothesis still has its merits, contributing to the progress of academic studies.
0.112956 - The author argues that assuming that the present and the future may repeat the past cannot be seen as unrealistic.
0.060444 - According to the literature, in order to make an economic prediction it is necessary to identify which variables determine or help to predict other economic variables.
0.110118 - This means looking to the past to identify which important variables may be used as indicators of other variables future behavior.
0.063927 - Furthermore, it also entails understanding the delayed influences of relationships between many variables, which are the most important ones to consider.
0.072696 - Many factors interact within the financial market, including political events, economic conditions, and market expectations itself (Gujarati, 2003; Morettin, 2008; Shue, Chen, & Shiue, 2009; Tucnik, 2009).
0.107345 - The biggest challenge in predicting stock prices is the complex nature of the field.
0.066667 - Most prediction models are rather limited when it comes to determine the direction of future prices, POCID, by virtue of the inherent difficulty in making accurate predictions, especially when major fluctuations occur.
0.062937 - This situation is particularly discouraging, since it is not sufficient to have low formal quantitative measures of accuracy (chiefly theRMSE (Root Mean Square Error) or MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)), the model needs to have a high accuracy rate for changes in direction – POCID, as upward and downwards movements are what really matters for decision-making.
0.122248 - Some studies have analyzed the POCID, such as the one of Neto, Tavares, Alves, Cavalcanti, and Tsang (2010) which presented a model based on neural networks using a series of PETR4 prices and exogenous data.
0.119497 - The accuracy rate of POCID obtained with the model was 83%.
0.124701 - Faria, Albuquerque, Gonzalez, Cavalcante, and Albuquerque (2009) presented different models for predicting the Ibovespa index based on neural networks, and attained a POCID result of 60%.
0.073059 - Tsai and Chiou (2009) combined neural networks with decision trees to improve accuracy, attaining a POCID accuracy rate of 81.08%.
0.130453 - Kara, Boyacioglu, and Baykan (2011) proposed the use of Artificial Neural Networks and support vector machines to predict the shares price index direction of the Istanbul Stock Exchange.
0.106280 - The proposed models achieved a POCID of 75.74–71.52% for neural networks and support vector machines, respectively.
0.103691 - As observed, there is a latent challenge to improve the accuracy for POCID, and this challenge is the motivation for this work that aims to improve the accuracy rate in the prediction of the POCID direction.
0.161447 - This study proposes the design of a model based on ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) for the financial market, allowing short term predictions of stock closing prices future behavior negotiated in BM&FBOVESPA, utilizing economic and financial theory, combining technical analysis, fundamental analysis and analysis of time series, so as to predict the behavior of prices.
0.099617 - Addressing the percentage of correct predictions of the direction of price series (POCID), as one of the main metrics for evaluating the performance of our model (Eq (1)).
0.082351 - This metric is important because it has direct effects on the financial gains and losses.
0.071582 - This research case study is Petrobras’ PETR4 stock.
0.160015 - The proposed methodology may be extended to stocks of enterprises in the same industry and adjusted to other industries.
0.067142 - This work considered, in addition to technical analysis, aspects of fundamental analysis.
0.109804 - This fact is considered a differential and a contribution to the context of forecasting stock prices, considering that the whole domain is interconnected to the share price.
0.128407 - In this example, one can cite the work of Atsalakis and Valavanis (2009), where the authors presented a study of several approaches to forecasting the stock market behavior, 75 studies used technical analysis and only 18 used fundamental analysis, a much smaller proportion.
0.096386 - (1) In this paper, the design of a model based on neural networks was carried out basing itself on tacit and explicit knowledge of the problem.
0.118280 - Prior studies and interviews with industry experts were conducted in order to acquire such tacit knowledge and to identify the components that may influence the future behavior of PETR4 stock prices.
0.109091 - The explicit knowledge was obtained and represented based on several existing theories.
0.115556 - Data and information allowed the construction of a database, which was submitted to pre-selection and pre-processing applying statistical analysis techniques.
0.149570 - With the data set, a model based on neural network was designed to predict the future stock price.
0.068027 - The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
0.160609 - In Section 2, related works and theoretical grounds of process modeling and prediction for the financial market is presented.

0.094457 - The two techniques have historically competed for the position of leading method in pricing of financial assets (Póvoa, 2008).
0.113721 - The fundamental analysis works with macroeconomic, industry and enterprise-specific fundamentals.
0.067847 - It studies the variation factors that affect the balance between supply and demand in the market, using variables that may affect the market in the present or in the future (Assaf, 2011; Francis, 1991; Frank, 2008; Lima, 2008; Póvoa, 2008).
0.091228 - The technical analysis or chartist analysis is a study dedicated to observe the evolution of markets based on its graphical representation in terms of purchase price, selling price, volume traded, among others.
0.118721 - The technical analysis assumes the premise that investors have a fairly uniform level of information and tend to repeat past behavior.
0.053140 - Graphics are simple, patterns are defined (price channels, head and shoulders, triangles, top and bottoms, gaps, flags, pennants etc.
0.106918 - ), which are the main tools to determine trends and future prices.
0.111111 - Technical analysts are essentially focused on understanding and analyzing the historical behavior of prices and volumes of assets in the past, in order to determine the current price or market conditions.
0.048193 - It also uses statistical methods to project the assets future price (Francis, 1991; Frank, 2008; Lima, 2008; Assaf, 2011; Achelis, 2001; Murphy, 1999; Póvoa, 2008).
0.061119 - Many techniques to predict the stock market have been developed using the various existing computational techniques, such as LR (Linear Regression)(Clements & Hendry, 1998; Clements, Milas, & van Dijk, 2009), ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) (Faria et al., 2009; Kara et al., 2011), GA (Genetic Algorithms) (Nayak, Misra, & Behera, 2012; Yang, Wu, & Lin, 2012), SVM (Support Vector Machines) (Wang, Wu, & Zhang, 2005; Wen, Yang, Song, and Jia (2010), CBR (Case-Based Reasoning) (Goswami, Bhensdadia, & Ganatra, 2009) and others (Guresen, Kayakutlu, & Daim, 2011).
0.067416 - ANN are non-linear computational models, capable of representation based on market behavior data, without previous knowledge of the relationships among input and output variables (Zhang, Patuwo, & Hu, 1998).
0.048685 - ANN have been widely used and have resulted in satisfactory performance compared to other approaches, which may be seen in the literature (Cai, Lai, & Lin, 2013; Chang, Liu, Lin, Fan, & Ng, 2009; de Oliveira, Zárate, de Azevedo Reis, & Nobre, 2011a, 2011b; González, Crespo, Palacios, Iglesias, & Berbis, 2011; Kara et al., 2011; Tsai & Chiou, 2009; Yoo, Kim, & Jan, 2005).
0.000000 - Guresen et al.
0.123948 - (2011) describe ANN as one of the best techniques to model the stock market, because it does not contain standard formulas and may be easily adapted to market changes.
0.107692 - ANN have the ability to learn by example and make interpolations and extrapolations of what they learned.
0.052805 - The use of ANN in the solution of a task initially involves a learning phase, which is when the network extracts the patterns, thereby creating a specific representation of the problem (Braga, Carvalho, & Ludermir, 2007).
0.132634 - The first model for prediction of stock price based on ANN was developed by White (1988).
0.107345 - The author used a feedforward network to detect unknown regularities in stock price changes.
0.105263 - The goal was to analyze the daily returns of IBM stock in order to test the efficient market theory, proposed by Fama (1970), which states that stock prices follow a random walk.
0.079365 - Although he has not obtained good predictive results, the research stressed the potential for such analysis.
0.107210 - Since then, a large number of researchers have actively participated in the development of predictive models that may be reliably applied in the stock market.
0.128985 - A later study conducted by Tsibouris and Zeidenberg (1995) tests the efficient market theory by analyzing six stocks of the US stock exchange, finding a capacity to predict prices based on historical series of prices.
0.067961 - Other studies, such as (Kolarik & Rudorfer, 1994; Refenes, 1991; Refenes, Azema-Barac, & Zapranis, 1993), observed that ANN obtain better prediction performance comparable to statistical techniques, such as the regression model and those obtained by ARIMA technique.
0.000000 - Nayak et al.
0.131262 - (2007) analyzed the clustering power of stock prices series and their ability to be utilized in predictive models using temporal recognition and brute force search to make the prediction.
0.102106 - Kolarik and Rudorfer (1994) proposed a univariate time series prediction system using neural networks.
0.099804 - In their research, they decided to use a fully connected feedforward network with one hidden layer and the backpropagation algorithm for network training.
0.107981 - The series used by the authors corresponds to common stock closing prices of IBM from May 1961 to November 1962.
0.124721 - Skabar and Cloete (2002) developed a methodology using trained neural networks, a genetic algorithm based on weight optimization was used to determine buying and selling points of financial products traded in the stock exchange.
0.112450 - They used four financial series where the price was compared to the returns obtained, by means of random data analysis from each one of the series.
0.089202 - The results indicated that the Dow Jones Industrial index was significantly higher than the expected price of the random series.
0.076465 - This supports the claim that some financial time series are not entirely random.
0.051852 - Some studies incorporated aspects of technical analysis.
0.139466 - For instance, Kim, Han, and Chandler (1998) used a recurrent Elman neural network to predict the price of stocks in the Japanese stock exchange.
0.090749 - Their method intended to find the ‘triangle’ graphic pattern to determine if price increases may be permanent, based on historical maximum, minimum and closing prices.
0.058921 - Technical indicators, such as moving averages, RSI (relative strength index) and other indicators were also used as input, along with the historical prices (de Oliveira et al., 2011a, 2011b; González et al., 2011; Kara et al., 2011; Leigh, Purvis, & Ragusa, 2002; Nagarajan, 2005).
0.108840 - The two main approaches based on neural networks for prediction of time series are concentrated on time windowing and on the use of recurrent neural networks.
0.084656 - Both attempt to capture the dynamics of the system that underlies the series’ data (Swingler, 1996).
0.105485 - The neural network has as an input a representation of the system current status and as an output a prediction of the future status.
0.097271 - The authors Waibel (1988), Refenes (1991) and McElroy and Wildi (2013) have shown how the temporal dimension may be transposed into a space vector.
0.050179 - They used a feedforward network with n inputs, such network is fed with one step at a time until the moment t, then the output unit is represented by t + 1.
0.054726 - There are two types of prediction: one-step-ahead (which uses an output neuron) and multiple-steps-ahead.
0.000000 - Zhang et al.
0.087432 - (1998) describe the two methods presented in the literature to make multiple-steps-ahead predictions.
0.113919 - The first is called iterative prediction and is used in the Box–Jenkins model, in which the prediction values are iteratively used as inputs for future predictions.
0.013605 - In this case, only one output neuron is required.
0.086758 - The second, known as the direct method, consists in placing several outputs in the neural network, corresponding to the prediction horizon.
0.032520 - According to Zhang et al.
0.100721 - (1998), the predictions of multiple steps ahead using the direct method may be better than the iterative method for two reasons.
0.117011 - Firstly, the neural network may be built directly for predictions of multiple steps ahead; secondly, the iterative method builds only one function, which is used to predict one point at a time and, subsequently, repeats such function to predict points in the future.
0.090202 - Ferreira, Vasconcelos, and Adeodato (2005) presented a new prediction method using time series, which performs an evolutionary search of the minimum necessary number of dimensions to be considered in the problem of determining the spatial characteristics of the time series.
0.093190 - The method proposed was inspired by the theorem of F. Takens and consists in a smart hybrid model composed of an Artificial Neural Network, combined with a GA. Braga et al.
0.107981 - (2007) described an example of prediction of the Bovespa index, where the model chosen for prediction was a feedforward network.
0.090909 - The MRE (mean relative error) obtained with the model was 1.85.
0.079365 - This shows that the neural networks are capable of predicting the Ibovespa series with significant accuracy.
0.063927 - The comparison of the performance of traditional methods with neural networks began in the 1990s, drawing the attention of many researchers.
0.077626 - According to Palit (2005), the linear prediction using nonlinear mapping of neural networks cannot produce better results than the statistical algorithms.
0.074703 - In the opposite case, using neural networks could definitely lead to better results in dealing with data from non-linear time series when compared to traditional algorithms.
0.134464 - The literature shows that the use of neural networks, as a method for prediction of time series, presents interesting and satisfactory results, being a promising alternative to traditional methods (Zhang et al., 1998).
0.098103 - The following steps (Fig 1) were used to build a neural model capable of making predictions of stocks closing prices short term future behavior traded in BM&FBOVESPA: (1) understanding of the problem domain and identification of key variables; (2) pre-selection and collection of samples; (3) pre-processing of inputs; and (4) modeling and prediction.
0.056738 - The following sections describe each of these steps.

0.107945 - Such variables represent the possible inputs for the model being proposed.
0.103030 - Enterprises can be segmented according to the activities performed and economy sectors.
0.092085 - Each sector has variables that affect only companies inside it and the various sectoral economic indicators, macroeconomic and market.
0.114478 - Due to the particularity of each sector and enterprise, it was necessary to conceptualize the behavior of PETR4 stock in order to understand and be able to capture the information that influences such stock.
0.062271 - This process was divided into three steps: (1) capture of tacit knowledge; (2) capture of explicit knowledge; and (3) construction of a conceptual map based on tacit and explicit knowledge.
0.056738 - The following subsections describe each of these steps.
0.069841 - Capture of tacit knowledge Financial analysts and investors have knowledge acquired throughout their lives by experience in operating in the market, by “tips” received from third parties and/or even based on their so-called ‘gut feeling’.
0.104478 - A multiple choice questionnaire was designed and made available on the internet to gather this type of knowledge.
0.111111 - The objective of this questionnaire was to collect the opinion of qualified professions on models, techniques and indicators used in the pricing of stocks, which may help identify the changes in stock prices in the short, medium and long term.

0.129825 - Concept map based on the tacit and explicit knowledge A conceptual map was designed (Fig 4) to help the understanding and representation of the set of variables that describe PETR4 stock behavior.
0.105263 - This map was build using the gathered information on tacit and explicit knowledge.
0.117371 - The map shows two distinct structures, each bringing together a set of variables related to the fundamental and technical analysis.
0.044444 - Stock’s behavior∗ Conceptual Map Fig 4.
0.048780 - Stock’s behavior∗ Conceptual Map.
0.026820 - ∗Stock’s behavior é o mais correto gramaticalmente, mas você encontra em textos Stock behavior, acredito que porque virou quase um termo padrão, assim como stock prices etc.
0.000000 - Não sei qual seria o mais correto usar, mas tomar o cuidado de usar da mesma forma no artigo inteiro.
0.151494 - Pre-selection and collection of samples The conceptual map (Fig 4) shows the variables which could form the set of necessary data for building a neural model to predict the PETR4 stock.
0.015504 - There were 46 variables in total.
0.123457 - The selection of variables was based on the conceptual map and depended on the availability and access to data required to build the sample set.
0.118368 - Table 5 shows the variables that were selected, because they had a sufficient number of samples and the access to historical series was available.
0.101961 - From all the variables identified using the conceptual map, the number of variables was reduced to 15, representing the technical vision, and 11 representing the fundamentalist vision.
0.078788 - Historical data were collected from sources in the public and private sectors.

0.079365 - Data collection The set of data samples was formed by the variables shown in Table 5.
0.067511 - The historical data refer to the monthly observations of variables over the period from January 2000 to December 2011, with 144 observations in total.
0.080619 - The periodicity of information is very important for the prediction process, because the lower the periodicity of the samples, the more difficult the prediction.
0.100721 - In the stock market, the prices may be sampled with the following periodicities: real-time, minute, hour, day, week, month etc.
0.108911 - In this research, the periodicity used was monthly, as most of the variables selected had their historical series available only with monthly observations, and stock prices with shorter periods were more subject to high volatility.
0.122441 - Cross-correlation analysis of variables The variables of the set of samples were analyzed using the cross-correlation function between the time series of the PETR4 stock closing price and other variables, to identify the relationship and statistical significance.

0.088604 - Setting the window size The window size (number of points of monthly series that is used as input of the neural network) is basically an empiric matter and impacts the learning and prediction capacity of the neural network (Zhang et al.
0.000000 - 1998).
0.100403 - An empiric method for obtaining the lag (delay) and the time influence of a series is to calculate its AC (AutoCorrelation) function and its correlogram and to discard the lags where the PAC (Partial AutoCorrelation) function is statistically irrelevant (Gujarati, 2003).
0.103030 - Fig 5 shows the correlogram of the PETR4 stock closing price attribute.
0.075472 - As can be seen, the first lagt − 1 was statistically relevant.

0.079208 - Pre-processing The set of samples had no missing data due to the monthly periodicity of the series, as the monthly value to be considered will always be the last sampling made in the month.
0.070588 - The same would not happen if the periodicity was daily, as some attributes could have missing data for holidays or days on which there was no trading.
0.071247 - An example is the series of the Dow Jones Index, which represents the average profitability of a stock portfolio of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which, due to the Brazilian holidays, will cause that the series of Brazilian prices to have missing values for such days, or vice versa.
0.082707 - Data normalization As the series of samples had scales with different values, it was necessary to adjust the scale of values for each series within the range [0.2, 0.8], based on the fact that the non-linear activation functions typically present asymptotic limits of 0 and 1 for infinity.
0.076923 - These values are not achieved, and values between 0.2 and 0.8 introduce the neural network’s ability to extrapolate (Zárate, Dias, & Song, 2008; Zhang et al., 1998).
0.058824 - The equation for data normalization is given by (Eq (2)).
0.076286 - (2) where: V′ is the normalized value; V the value to be normalized; Min the minimum value of the series to be normalized; Max the maximum value of the series to be normalized; nMax the maximum value of the range; and nMin the minimum value of the range.

0.053333 - The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), shown in Eq (6), is the mean or average of the absolute percentage errors of forecasts.
0.054545 - Error is defined as actual or observed value minus the forecasted value.
0.028369 - Percentage absolute errors are added to compute MAPE.
0.054645 - This measure is easy to understand because it provides the error in terms of percentages.
0.070423 - Also, because absolute percentage errors are used, the problem of positive and negative errors canceling each other out is avoided.
0.074067 - (7) The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), shown in Eq (7), is employed as an indicator for the predictive power or prediction agreement.
0.072727 - A low RMSE indicates that the prediction agrees with the real data.
