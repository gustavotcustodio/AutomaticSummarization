Cruise control system which is able to manage the pedals of a vehicle at low speeds.
On-line evolved fuzzy controller to adapt the actions to unknown road or vehicle.
Experimentation in 40 different vehicles in simulation with similar results in all.
Experimentation in a real vehicle in hard situations (slopes, very low speed).
Better results than human driver in changing/maintaining speed.
