We formulate a regularized penalty function solution for the multi-objective constrained problem.
We prove that exists a solution of the original problem with minimal weighted norm which is unique.
We suggest a projection-gradient algorithm for computing the penalty function.
We prove the convergence of the gradient method and the rate of convergence.
We present a method that make the Pareto frontier more useful as decision support system.
