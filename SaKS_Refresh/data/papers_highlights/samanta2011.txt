Prediction of chaotic time series using two hybridCI techniques is considered.
Single multiplicative neuron (SMN) model is used in place of conventional ANN.
SMN model parameters are estimated using cooperative particle swam optimization.
Results are compared with adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).
Both show good results but ANFIS performs better for all three benchmark datasets.
