Neural network modeling has best correlation to evaluating the effects of coal chemical properties on FSI.
Results from ANN showed that nitrogen (dry), carbon (dry), hydrogen (dry), Btu (dry), volatile matter (dry) and fixed carbon (dry) had positive effects on free swelling index, respectively.
The negative effects of input parameters were related to moisture, oxygen (dry), ash (dry) and total sulfur (dry), respectively.
The fixed carbon was found to have the lowest effect (0.0425) on FSI.
