A two stage hybrid ANN-GA approach is presented.
Optimal initial weights and biases for training ANN were determined using GA.
The optimal initial weights and biases were fined tuned using BP algorithm.
The ANN-GA hybrid model showed improved prediction accuracy and fast convergence.
The model can be used for predicting slump of RMC in quick time.
