We formally introduce Lyapunov games for Markov chains.
We provide the convergence analysis for pure stationary strategies in Lyapunov games.
We provide an algorithm for the numerical realization of the best-reply strategy.
We prove under mild assumptions that the Nash, Lyapunov and Correlated equilibria coincide.
