Three artificial intelligence (AI) methods for modeling output voltage of microbial fuel cell (MFC) system is discussed.
AI models efficiently establish the relationship between output voltage and input factors of MFC.
Out of three methods, MGGP evolves a model with better generalization ability.
MGGP shows excellent potential to predict performance of MFC and can be used to gain better insights into MFC system.
