A novel approach of morphological segmentation based on edge detection (MSED) is proposed and applied.
The morphological features, including area, ratio of major axis length to minor axis length, and eccentricity, of sewer pipe defects on CCTV images are measured.
MSED can effectively diagnose sewer pipe defects, such as fractures, spalling large, collapse, open joint, and deformed sewer.
