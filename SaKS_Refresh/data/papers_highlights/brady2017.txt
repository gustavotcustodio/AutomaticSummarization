The paper presents a novel application of an evolutionary algorithm.
The paper presents a novel way of determining the Nash equilibrium.
The approach can be used when analytical or closed-form solutions are not possible.
It can handle non-linear functions for demand/cost and environmental constraints.
Results have been validated against solutions obtained analytically.
