We apply Particle Swarm Optimization approach for parameter optimization of quantum well nano structure.
Mobility of two-dimensional hot electrons in AlGaAs/GaAs quantum well is taken as the fitness/objective function.
The 2D carrier concentration, quantum well width and lattice temperature of the quantum well are taken as the three input variables of the algorithm.
Results show that the swarm approach can be successfully implemented for parameter optimization of complex nanostructure.
