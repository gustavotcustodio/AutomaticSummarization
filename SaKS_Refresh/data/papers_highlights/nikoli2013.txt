We study the transit network design problem.
We propose the simple greedy algorithm for generating the initial solution.
We develop the model based on the Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) metaheuristic to discover the best transit network topology.
The numerical experiments are performed on the known benchmark problems.
The obtained numerical results show that the proposed approach can find high-quality solutions.
