The model predicts the breakthrough times of sorption of two pharmaceuticals.
The performance is predicted using very easily measurable operational parameters.
2–4–6 MLP is sufficient to describe the breakthrough time.
The robustness of the model is explored with sensitivity analysis of input parameters.
Practical implication of the study is delineated.
