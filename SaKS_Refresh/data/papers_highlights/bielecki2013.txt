A syntactic algorithm of a two-dimensional object vectorization is introduced.
A syntactic algorithm of a two-dimensional object recognition is proposed.
An algorithm of two-dimensional map recognition is introduced.
The algorithms have been tested by using both artificial data and real data â€“ the satellite image.
