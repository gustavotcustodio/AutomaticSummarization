In this study, we proposed a new hybrid model of SOM-LSSVM for time series forecasting.
To varify the results, two well-known datasets know as the sunspot data and the unemployed young women data are used.
The hybrid model outperform the single LSSVM modelbased on MAE and RMSE.
The hybrid model provide an alternative technique in forecasting.
