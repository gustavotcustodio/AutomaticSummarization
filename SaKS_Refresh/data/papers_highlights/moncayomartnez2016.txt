This is the first attempt to solve the SC design problem using IWD metaheuristic.
We modify the single-objective IWD meta-heuristic to solve a bi-objective SC design problem.
We compare our results to the ones computed by Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO).
We solve several instances to show the performance of our hybrid algorithm.
Our results outperform the ones computed by ACO.
