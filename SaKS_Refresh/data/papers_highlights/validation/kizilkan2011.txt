Thermodynamic performance modeling of variable speed refrigeration system was carried out using artificial neural networks.
Backpropagation learning algorithm with two different variants used in the network. Logistic sigmoid transfer function was used.
Eighty percent of data patterns for training and twenty percent for testing procedure were used.
The best fitting training data set was found to be with eight neurons in the hidden layer.
Statistical error values were found to be within acceptable uncertainties. Predicted values were very close to actual values.
