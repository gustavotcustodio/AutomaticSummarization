We propose swarm algorithms for the extraction of features in an image.
We study self-organization of elemental processing units.
Our algorithm implements autonomous adaptation with automatic learning of thresholds for optimal segmentation.
The proposed method works with a multitude of swarms of particles and changing image characteristics.
