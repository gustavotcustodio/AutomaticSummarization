Tumor markers were measured in 50 patients with lung cancer and 40 patients with benign diseases.
Most valuable biomarkers are selected and grouped through multiple logistic regressions analysis.
The optimal marker group-coupled ANN model was employed as an intelligent diagnosis system.
This system has a diagnosis specificity of 100.0% and diagnosis accuracy 92.8%.
The ANN-based system provides a rapid and accurate diagnosis tool for lung cancer.
