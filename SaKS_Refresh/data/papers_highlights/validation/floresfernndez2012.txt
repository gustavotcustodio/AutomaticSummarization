We evaluated serum biomarkers levels in lung cancer patients and non-cancer controls.
We used principal component analysis and artificial neural network modeling.
We found a reduced biomarker panel composed of Cyfra 21.1, CEA, CA125 and CRP.
ANN modeling offers a powerful diagnostic tool to improve biomarker efficiency.
