We propose a system for texture analysis and classification of lesions in mammograms.
We validate the method by quantitative evaluation.
We also made a comparison with other artificial intelligence algorithms.
The method allows classification with average value 0.98 of Az.
The method is effective in 360 digitized mammograms from DDSM database.
