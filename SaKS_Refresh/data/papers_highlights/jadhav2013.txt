Wind power is incorporated in economic emission dispatch problem.
The stochastic nature of wind power is model using weibull probability function.
Gbest guided artificial bee colony algorithm is proposed to find optimal solutions.
The proposed algorithm is applied to IEEE-30 bus, 6, 15 and 40 unit test systems.
The proposed algorithm is compared with several recently proposed algorithms.
