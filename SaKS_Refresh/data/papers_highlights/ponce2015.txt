A fuzzy-molecular based controller for coupled-tanks systems is proposed.
Performance of our controller is higher over conventional PID controllers.
Our controller is robust for different discharge rate levels at the secondary tank.
Tracking and robustness experiments showed a steady-state error of 1 mm, in average.
