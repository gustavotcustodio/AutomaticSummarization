We propose a solution to the inverse kinematics problem of a human upper limb.
We evaluate two artificial intelligence-based technologies: MLP and ANFIS.
We propose a novel application in ADL-based physical Neurorehabilitation.
We demonstrate that both solutions provide accurate results.
We demonstrate that the MLP-based is able to work in a real-time environment.
