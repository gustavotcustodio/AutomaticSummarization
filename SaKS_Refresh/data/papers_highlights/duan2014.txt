We propose estimating multiple true labels for multi-labeled instances.
We flexibly incorporate label dependency into the label-generation process.
It is effective to simultaneously estimate the states of strongly related labels.
Reliable results are estimated using the opinions of a few crowdsourcing workers.
Our models can reduce the cost of multi-label data collection for AI techniques.
