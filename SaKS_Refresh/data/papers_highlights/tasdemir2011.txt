In this study, we modeled gasoline engine performance and emission parameters with fuzzy expert system (FES) and artificial neural network (ANN).
ANN and FES approach has been applied comparatively for predicting engine power, torque, specific fuel consumption, and emission of hydrocarbon.
The correlation coefficients are resulted 0.99938 and 0.99965 for experiment-ANN and experiment-FES respectively. Also, mean absolute percentage accuracies are 0.9622 for ANN and 0.9743 for FES.
Unperformed experiments are predicted with developed systems for engine performance and emission parameters.
Consequently, with the use of ANN and FES, the performance and exhaust emissions of the internal combustion engines can easily be estimated.
