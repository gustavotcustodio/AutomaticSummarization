Improving classification accuracy of project dispute resolution using hybrid artificial intelligence and support vector machine models

Abstract

Support vector machines (SVMs) have been applied successfully to construction knowledge domains. However, SVMs, as a baseline model, still have a potential improvement space by integrating hybrid intelligence. This work compares the performance of various classification models using the combination of fuzzy logic, a fast and messy genetic algorithm, and SVMs. A set of public–private partnership projects was collected as a real case study in construction management. The data were split into mutually independent folds for cross validation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid artificial intelligence system has the best and most reliable classification accuracy at 77.04%, a 24.76% improvement compared with that of SVMs in predicting project dispute resolution (PDR) outcomes (i.e., mediation, arbitration, litigation, negotiation, and administrative appeals) when the dispute category and phase in which a dispute occurs are known during project execution. This work demonstrates the improvement capability of hybrid intelligence in classifying PDR predictions related to public infrastructure projects.

1. Introduction

Construction projects, by their nature, are highly uncertain and intrinsically experience-oriented. Experience as tacit knowledge should be preserved and managed properly. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to simulate human inference and capture experience via state-of-the-art analytical tools. Artificial intelligence refers to computing technologies that handle complex or poorly structured problems using such tools as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). As AI-based models can cope with tasks at which humans excel, utilizing an AI inference model is a viable alternative and a promising solution to the field of construction engineering and management (CEM).

In the CEM knowledge domain, project dispute resolutions are challenging when making early strategic decisions. Although the public sector is risk-averse and typically avoids financial guarantees, government support for construction projects is common in both developing and developed countries. However, due to the high risks associated with the construction industry, project delays, budget overruns, poor construction quality, and legal issues during implementation, construction, operating, and transfer phases can cause project disputes among stakeholders. Many studies (Arditi & Pulket, 2010; Chen, 2008; Chen & Hsu, 2007; Cheng, Tsai, & Chiu, 2009; Chou, 2012) have demonstrated that an efficient, effective, and fair warning model of potential disputes or construction claims during the early planning phase is essential to project success.

Research has shown that ANNs and SVMs are effective tools for solving construction management (CM) problems (Arditi & Tokdemir, 1999a; Chen & Hsu, 2007; Chou, 2012; Lin & Hsu, 2002). However, ANNs have difficulties in identifying the optimal architecture, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in layers, and learning rate (Chou, 2012). Additionally, their training process is typically optimized locally and time consuming. This work attempts to improve the prediction accuracy of SVMs when applied for construction dispute resolution. Despite the superiority of SVMs, no study has investigated accuracy improvements by fusing hybrid intelligence (i.e., a fast and messy genetic algorithm (fmGA) and fuzzy logic (FL) in this work) with SVMs, the baseline model.

Specifically, FL, a popular AI technique invented by Zadeh in the 1960s, has been used in forecasting, decision-making, and action control in environments characterized by uncertainty, vagueness, presumptions, and subjectivity (Bojadziev & Bojadziev, 2007). Fuzzy logic consists of a set of rules that relates a set of inputs to a set of outputs. Quantitative relationships are established through membership functions (MFs) between actual variable values and qualitative, linguistic variables used in “if-then” rules (Zadeh, 1973). The goal of an FL paradigm is to mimic the human inference.

The fmGA-based approach developed by Goldberg, Deb, Kargupta, and Harik (1993) is known for its flexibility in allowing hybridization with other methodologies to obtain enhanced solutions. The primary difference between an fmGA and other genetic approaches is its ability to manipulate explicitly building blocks of genetic material to obtain good solutions and potentially the global optimum. Thus, to demonstrate the efficacy of combining the above AI-based techniques, this work compares classification performance to predict project dispute resolutions using SVMs as a benchmark, along with the performance of the SVMs + fmGA model, and SVMs + fmGA + FL model.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 thoroughly reviews AI literature and the application of AI to predict construction claims and litigation outcomes. Section 3 then characterizes the research methodology, providing a theoretical basis for classification models adopted in subsequent investigations. Section 4 describes the project dispute database and compares model performance based on classification techniques. Conclusions are given in Section 5, along with directions for future research.
2. Literature review

The data mining- and AI-based approaches are related to computer system programs that attempt to resolve problems intelligently by emulating human brain processes. As AI technology enhances the ability of computer programs to complete tasks at which humans remain superior (Haykin, 1999), AI techniques are typically applied to solve prediction and classification problems. Researchers in various scientific and engineering fields have recently combined different AI models to enhance overall performance.

Several studies have attempted to minimize the number of construction litigation cases by predicting likely court rulings. Arditi, Oksay, and Tokdemir (1998), who trained a network using Illinois appellate court data, achieved 67% accuracy in predicting litigation outcomes (Arditi et al., 1998). They argued that when parties in a dispute know with some certainty how a court will resolve a case, the number of disputes can be reduced markedly. Other AI techniques have achieved excellent prediction accuracy with the same dataset: a prediction accuracy of 83.33% was attained with a case-based reasoning model (Arditi & Tokdemir, 1999b); a prediction accuracy of 89.95% was achieved with boosted decision trees (Arditi & Pulket, 2005); and, a prediction accuracy of 91.15% was attained with integrated prediction modeling (Arditi & Pulket, 2010).

However, Chau (2007) found that, excluding the above case studies, AI techniques are rarely applied to the legal field (Chau, 2007). Thus, Chau utilized ANNs based on particle swarm optimization to predict construction litigation outcomes, a field in which relatively new data mining (DM) techniques are rarely applied. The network developed by Chau achieved a prediction accuracy rate of 80%, markedly exceeding that of chance. Nevertheless, Chau suggested that additional case factors related to cultural, psychological, social, environmental, and political characteristics should be used in future work.

For construction disputes triggered by a change order for a construction process or design, Chen (2008) developed a K Nearest Neighbour (kNN) pattern classification scheme that identifies potential lawsuits based on a nationwide study of US court records (Chen, 2008). Chen demonstrated that the kNN approach attains a classification accuracy of 84.38%. Chen and Hsu (2007) applied a hybrid artificial neural network and case-based reasoning (ANN–CBR) model to a disputed change order dataset to obtain early warning information. Their classifier achieved a prediction rate of 84.61% (Chen & Hsu, 2007).

Although several studies have applied CBR and its variations to identify similar dispute cases as references for dispute settlements, Cheng et al. (2009) further refined and improved the conventional CBR approach by combining fuzzy set theory with a new similarity measurement that integrates Euclidean distance and cosine angle distance (Cheng et al., 2009). Their model extracted the knowledge and experience of experts from 153 construction dispute cases collected manually from multiple sources.

Surprisingly, the performance of SVMs and their variations in classifying project dispute resolutions has rarely been examined. Support vector machines were originally designed for binary classification. How to extend SVMs to multilabel classification remains an on-going research project as is the combination of AI techniques and SVMs. Hsu and Lin compared two methods based on binary classifications: “one-against-all” and “one-against-one. They demonstrated experimentally that the “one-against-one” (Lin, 2002) method is more suitable for practical use than the one-against-all method. This work therefore investigates the improvement of SVMs in classifying dispute resolutions by integrating hybrid intelligence, namely, an fmGA and FL.
3. Research methodology

In the proposed models, multi-class SVMs primarily address learning and classification, the FL paradigm mimics human inference, and the fmGA primarily addresses optimization. The following sections describe the proposed classification algorithms concisely.
3.1. Support vector machines

In classification problems, SVMs identify a separate hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes. Maximizing the margin is a quadratic programming problem that can be solved by utilizing Lagrangian multipliers (Han & Kamber, 2001; Tan, Steinbach, & Kumar, 2006; Witten & Frank, 2005). However, searching for a suitable hyperplane in an input space is typically too restrictive for practical use. One solution is to map the input space into a higher dimensional feature space before searching for the optimal hyperplane. Even without mapping knowledge, SVMs can still identify the optimal hyperplane using dot product functions, called kernels, in a feature space. The optimal hyperplane can be expressed as a combination of several input points, called support vectors.

The main purpose of SVMs is to estimate a classification function using input–output training data from two classes (x1, y1), …, (xn, yn) ϵ RN × {±1}. The SVMs limit analysis to linear classification functions, with the goal of establishing a hyperplane equation that divides training data and leaves all points of the same class on the same side, while maximizing the minimum distances between the hyperplane and each of the two classes (w, b), where w represents the weight vector that realizes a functional margin of 1 on positive point x+and negative point x−. Thus, the geometric margin can be computed as follows:
(1)

The optimal hyperplane, w ⋅ x + b = 0, is geometrically equivalent to maximizing the margin, i.e., the distance between the two parallel planes, w ⋅ x + b = 1 and w ⋅ x + b = −1. The Euclidean length of the margin is
, where . The maximum margin is also the minimum two-norm subject to constraint Eq. (2). Therefore, the problem can be formulated as
(2)

Since classes can rarely be separated linearly, the generalized optimal plane problem is required. A set of variables ξ that measures constraint variation is added for each point. The final problem formulation is
(3)

where C is a penalty parameter chosen by the fmGA in this work (introduced in the following section), and ξ is the error penalty.

Eq. (3) can be solved by applying classical Lagrange multipliers and Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions (Vapnik, 1995). The decision function can be written as
(4)

where αi, b is calculated using training data, and K(x, xi) is a kernel function.

The kernel functions K(x, xi) used typically include polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid kernels (Witten & Frank, 2005) (Eq. (5)). However, kernel parameters in kernel functions must be optimized to maximize their predictive accuracy.

    Polynomial kernel:

    Radial basis function kernel:

(6)

    Sigmoid kernel:

(7)

The RBF kernel maps samples nonlinearly into a higher dimensional space. Therefore, unlike linear regression, the RBF kernel can solve nonlinear relationships between class labels and attributes. The linear kernel is a special RBF kernel, since a linear kernel with a penalty parameter C performs similarly to an RBF kernel with certain parameters (C; γ) (Huang & Wang, 2006).

The sigmoid kernel also behaves like the RBF kernel for certain parameters. The reason is that the number of hyper parameters affects model selection complexity. The polynomial kernel has more hyper parameters than the RBF kernel. Thus, the RBF kernel presents fewer numerical difficulties.

However, the RBF kernel may be unsuitable in some cases. For instance, only the linear kernel should be used when many features exist. In this work, SVMs and the RBF kernel were used as the first baseline model to compare the performance of hybrid intelligence combined with the fmGA and FL.
3.2. SVMs and fmGA hybrid

Notably, fmGAs are characterized by their relative immunity to high dimensionality and local minima, and their potential for use in hybrid SVMs. These advantages make fmGAs logical candidates for overcoming the disadvantages of SVMs. Unlike the well-known simple GA (GAs), which uses fixed-length strings to represent possible solutions, fmGAs form strings of varying lengths from messy chromosomes. These fmGAs can also optimize solutions efficiently in large permutation problems. Particularly, they can simultaneously optimize SVM parameters C and γ.

The main difference between the fmGA and other GAs is its ability to manipulate explicitly the building blocks of genetic material to obtain good solutions and potentially the global optimum. The fmGA contains three operational phases: the initialization phase; the building-block filtering phase; and, the juxtapositional phase, which includes various parameters (Goldberg et al., 1993). Fig. 1 shows the procedures of the fmGA.
Process of the fmGA



Fig. 1. Process of the fmGA.

The fmGA and SVMs have proven effective in solving various project-management problems (Cheng, Peng, Wu, & Liao, 2011; Cheng & Roy, 2011; Cheng & Wu, 2009; Chou, Cheng, Wu, & Tai, 2011). Based on their characteristics and merits, the fmGA and SVMs were combined as the second baseline model, i.e., the SVMs + fmGA model. In this model, the SVMs primarily address learning and curve fitting, while the fmGA is focused on optimization. This model was developed to optimize parameters C and γ with minimal prediction error.

Fig. 2 shows the structure of the SVMs + fmGA model. The following steps must be followed to establish an accurate fmGA-based parameter-optimization model. A detailed explanation follows.

(1)

    The SVM training model. In this step, the SVM uses default parameters and a training dataset to train a prediction model.
(2)

    Average accuracy. For each chromosome representing C and γ, a training dataset is used to train the SVM and calculate accuracy. When accuracy is obtained, each chromosome is evaluated using a fitness function.
(3)

    Termination criteria. The process ends once termination criteria are met. When termination criteria are not met, the model proceeds to the next generation.
(4)

    The fmGA parameters search. In this step, the model searches for better solutions via genetic operations.

3.3. Hybridization of SVMs, fmGA, and FL

Construction projects are, by their nature, challenging, and project decision-makers must work successfully in an environment that is frequently complex with a considerable amount of uncertainty. As many decisions must be made intuitively based on limited information, successful decision-making depends markedly on two factors, the experience of experts and the quality of knowledge accumulated from experience. Knowledge, however, is subject to the influence of various factors that cause its value and accuracy to deteriorate.

An AI hybrid system that combines FL, SVMs and an fmGA is an alternative approach to retaining and utilizing experiential knowledge (Fig. 3). An fmGA, an optimization tool, is applied to search simultaneously for the fittest MFs, the defuzzification parameter (dfp), and the SVM hyperparameter (herein C and γ). Two simulations of actual engineering problems demonstrated that the hybrid system is an effective tool for solving CM problems (Cheng & Roy, 2010).
The SVMs+fmGA+SVMs model



Fig. 3. The SVMs + fmGA + SVMs model.

The major steps of the hybrid model are as follows.

(1)

    Training data. The system uses sequential data as training data. Training data are normalized into a (0, 1) range, which helps avoid attributes with large numeric ranges dominating those with small numeric ranges, and also helps avoid numerical difficulties. The function used to normalize data is Eq. (8).
    (8)

(2)

    Data weighting. Each training data point is weighted to the time function using either a linear or quadratic function (Fig. 4). The last point, xm, from the recent past, is treated as the most important and, as such, has a weighting value sm of one. The first point, x1, from the most distant past, is treated as least important, and is given a weighting value s1 of σ. In this step, the lower bound of weighting data parameters (σ) are generated randomly in the range of 0.1–1 and encoded by the fmGA. The points from the recent past were given higher weights than those from the more distant past in accordance with two different time functions—the linear and quadratic functions (Fig. 4).

    Fuzzification. This process converts each normalized input variable value from the first step into corresponding membership grades. The MFs are used to map normalized input variables to their corresponding membership grades. This work used trapezoidal MFs and triangular MFs (Fig. 5) that, in general, can be developed by referencing summit points and widths. The summit and width representation method (SWRM) was applied to encode complete MF sets (Fig. 5(c)). Each normalized input pattern was converted into membership grades corresponding to the specific MF set generated and encoded by the fmGA. Fig. 6 shows the fuzzification process.

    Weighted SVMs training model. In this step, weighted SVMs, developed based on SVMs, were deployed to handle fuzzy input–output mapping. Fuzzification process output, in the form of membership grades, is fuzzy input for weighted SVMs. Weighted SVMs train this dataset to obtain the prediction model. Weighted SVMs use penalty (C) and kernel parameters (γ), which are generated randomly and encoded by the fmGA. This work used the RBF kernel function based on its ability to analyze high-dimensional data, its use of only one hyperparameter when searching, and the need for few numerical analyses.
(5)

    Defuzzification. Once weighted SVMs have completed the training process, output numbers are expressed in terms of the fuzzy set, and must be converted into a single real number. This conversion process is called defuzzification. By applying the fmGA, the hybrid system generates a random dfp substring, and encodes for the weighted SVMs output. This evolutionary approach is both simple and straightforward, as it uses dfp as a common denominator for weighted output from SVMs.
(6)

    The fmGA parameter search. The fmGA is applied to search simultaneously for the fittest shapes of MFs, dfp, penalty parameter C, RBF kernel parameter γ and the lower boundary of weighted data parameter σ. The fmGA proceeds using genetic operations. Thus, chromosome design plays a central role in achieving objectives. The chromosome representing a possible solution for searched parameters consists of five parts: the MFs substring; dfp substring; penalty parameter substring; kernel parameter substring; and, the lower bound of the weighting data substring. Each substring has a specific length, and it should fit certain requirements corresponding to the searched parameter, including the length of the decimal point string and the upper and lower parameter bounds. The chromosome, as the model variable in the proposed hybrid system, is encoded into a binary string. Chromosomes consist of two segments, FL and the weighted SVMs. The FL segment contains the MF and dfp substrings. The weighted SVMs segment contains penalty parameter C, kernel parameter γ from the RBF function, and the lower boundary of weighted data parameter σ. Fig. 7 shows the chromosome structure.
    Chromosome structure

    

    Fig. 7. Chromosome structure.

    As mentioned, MF substrings are encoded using the SWRM method, which defines the distribution of uneven MFs by their summits and widths (Fig. 5(c)). In Fig. 5(a), summits of the trapezoidal MF are sm1 and sm2, whereas the left and right widths are wd1 and wd2, respectively. A triangular MF may be regarded as a special trapezoidal MF case in which sm1 = sm2. A complete MF set includes two shoulders. Fig. 5(c) shows the complete trapezoidal MF set, consisting of five summit points (i.e., sm1, sm2, sm3, sm4, and sm5) and four widths (i.e., wd1, wd2, wd3, and wd4). When applying the SWRM method, the required length of the MF binary substring, RLMF, can be defined as follows:
    (9)
where rncMF is the required number of complete MF sets, nsm is the number of summits in a complete MF set, rlsm is the required length for a summit that depends on demand, nwd is the number of widths in one complete MF set, and rlwd is the required demand-dependent width. As each input variable uses a common complete MF set to fuzzify crisp input data, rncMF is derived as follows:
(10)
where niv is the number of input variables. The dfp is a number searched by the fmGA, which converts fuzzy output from the inference engine into crisp output. The required length rlx of the dfp binary substring may be defined by adopting the variable mapping function from the domain [lbx, ubx] as follows:
(11)
where rp is the required number of places after the decimal point, and lbx and ubx are the lower and upper bound values of variable x, respectively. Taking log functions on both sides of the right-hand parts above yields
(12)

    For the weighted SVMs parameter segment, which contains three substrings (i.e., the penalty parameter C substring, γ substring, and σ substring), the required length of each binary C and that of the γ and σ substrings are computed using Eq. (12).
(7)

    Fitness evaluation. Every chromosome that represents MFs, dfp, C, γ and σ is encoded and utilized to train the dataset. Model accuracy is acquired when a prediction model from the training dataset is obtained. Each chromosome is further evaluated using a fitness function. The fitness function was designed to assess model accuracy and the fitness of generalization properties. This function describes the fittest shape of MFs, the optimized dfp number, and weighted SVM parameters. The fitness function in Eq. (13) is the reciprocal of the objective function.
    (13)
The aim of model fob is to integrate model accuracy and model complexity, as expressed in Eq. (14).
(14)

    where caw is the accuracy weighting coefficient, ser is prediction error between actual output and desired output, ccw is the complexity weighting coefficient, and mc is model complexity, which can be assessed simply by counting the number of support vectors.
(8)

    Termination criteria. The process is terminated when termination criteria are met. When criteria remain unsatisfied, the model proceeds to the next generation. As the hybrid system uses the fmGA, the termination criterion used is either the number of eras (k) or the number of epochs (e). The loop process continues when the specified criteria are not met.
(9)

    Optimal prediction model. The loop stops once the termination criterion is fulfilled, meaning that the prediction model has identified the input/output mapping relationship with the optimal C, γ, σ, and dfp parameters.

3.4. Cross validation

When comparing the predictive accuracy of two or more methods, researchers often use k-fold cross validation to minimize bias associated with randomly sampled training and holdout data. Since cross validation requires the random assignment of individual cases into distinct folds, a common practice is to stratify the folds. In stratified k-fold cross validation, the proportions of predictor labels (responses) in folds typically approximate those in the original dataset.

Empirical studies show that, compared with regular k-fold cross validation, stratified cross validation tends to reduce bias in comparison results (Han & Kamber, 2001). Kohavi (1995) confirmed that ten-fold validation testing obtains the optimal computational time and variance (Kohavi, 1995). Thus, a stratified ten-fold cross-validation approach was applied to assess model performance in this work. The entire dataset was divided into ten mutually exclusive subsets (or folds) with class distributions approximating those of the original dataset (stratified). The subsets were extracted via the following five steps.

    Step 1. Randomize the dataset.

    Step 2. Extract one tenth of the original dataset’s size from the randomized dataset (single fold).

    Step 3. Remove the extracted data from the original dataset.

    Step 4. Repeat steps 1–3 eight times.

    Step 5. Assign the remaining portion of the dataset to the last (tenth) fold.

Each of the ten folds obtained by this procedure were then used once for each performance test of the SVM model, the SVMs + fmGA model, and the SVMs + fmGA + FL model. The remaining nine folds were used for training, which obtained ten independent performance estimates. The cross-validation estimate of overall accuracy was derived by averaging the k individual accuracy measures for cross-validation accuracy.
4. Experimental results and models comparison

To demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed classification schemes, this work used public–private partnership (PPP) project data collected by the Taiwan public construction commission (TPCC)—the governmental authority overseeing public services and infrastructure construction in Taiwan—in the proposed classification models to predict dispute resolutions under a given information set. The following sections describe background information of dispute data, model settings, experimental results, and accuracy comparisons.
4.1. Dispute data and exploratory analysis

The database contains 152 PPP dispute projects overseen by the TPCC during 2002–2009. Table 1. summarizes the statistical profile of categorical labels and numerical ranges for samples. During contracting and procurement, 67.1% of projects were overseen by Taiwan’s central government. Over this eight-year period, the most dispute occurrence of public construction projects were sanitation and medical facilities (17.1%), major tourism facilities (14.5%), cultural and educational facilities (13.2%), agricultural facilities (11.2%), and transportation facilities (10.5%). Notably, 44.1% and 41.4% of disputed projects were in northern and southern Taiwan, respectively. Using the standard industry definition, most disputes occurred in the secondary sector, the industrial sector (38.6%) and the tertiary sector, the service sector (42.1%). In disputed cases, the government provided both land and facility designs to attract investors (92.1%).

Among the disputed projects, the three major procurement strategies for delivering public services were build operation and transfer (BOT) (49.3%), operate and transfer (OT) (32.2%), and rehabilitate, operate, and transfer (ROT) (18.4%). The world bank group (WBG) (WBG., 2011) defines BOT as a strategy in which a private sponsor builds a new facility, operates that facility, and then transfers the facility to a government at the contract’s end. The government typically provides revenue guarantees via long-term take-or-pay contracts. When a private sponsor renovates an existing facility, and then operates and maintains that facility at its own risk for a contracted period, the PPP strategy according to WBG classifications is ROT. Projects involving only management and lease contracts are OT projects.

Further, flagship infrastructure projects are both important and large. The average project value of disputed cases was approximately NT$1.519 billion with a standard deviation of NT$4.250 billion for the period 2002–2009. Based on collected data, the total value of disputed projects was roughly NT$291 billion. Mean capital investment by the government and private sectors per project was NT$159 million and NT$1.755 billion, respectively. Notably, the average private capital investment ratio was as high as 94.35%. Mean operating duration for licensed facilities was approximately 20.15 years (maximum, 60 years).

A comparison only of the dispute category and phase during which a dispute occurs indicates that disputes likely occur during the build (B) and operating (O) phases (Table 2). The most frequent disputes (Table 2) were as follows: financing and tax issues (F) (22.4%); operation and management (18.4%) (OM); contract and legal issues (C) (17.8%); design, construction and commissioning (D) (17.8%); and, government commitments (G) (14.5%). Asset ownership and transfer issues (A) (5.9%) and market and revenue (M) (3.3%) had the lowest likelihood of generating disputes.

Of all dispute cases, disputes generally occurred during the B (40.8%) and O (55.9%) phases, while the transfer phase (3.3%) had a comparatively smaller dispute likelihood. Cross analysis using a bar chart (Fig. 8) demonstrates that events occurring most frequently in the B, O, and transfer phases were D, F, and A, respectively.

To assess dependencies among categorized data, a contingency table was analyzed between distinct predictors and the response variable (Table 3). Compared with municipal and local agencies, the central government had a relatively higher tendency, during any dispute resolution, to litigate. Likewise, water conservation facilities (ARB), sanitation and medical facilities (LIT or NEG), cultural and educational facilities (ADM), and major tourism facilities (MED) had the highest dispute resolution frequencies.

Note: MED: mediation; ARB: arbitration; LIT: litigation; NEG: negotiation; ADM: administrative appeals.

When the government provided land and a facility’s plans, disputes occurred most frequently. Of the PPP strategies, the frequency of MED and ARB for a resolution was highest in BOT projects. The OT projects had a high propensity for LIT, NEG, and ADM. Notably, once a project was legally codified as a major PPP infrastructure project, the frequency of almost every dispute resolution was lower than that for non-major infrastructure projects.

Moreover, when project cost exceeded NT$50 million, the most common dispute resolutions were, in descending order, MED, ARB, NEG, and ADM. However, when private sector investment exceeded 75% of total project cost, the likelihood of a dispute occurring increased. Notably, the number of disputes decreased as operating duration increased. In terms of contract, operating, and maintenance issues, LIT, NEG, and ADM were used most often for dispute resolution. For financing and tax issues, MED and ARB were the most commonly used methods for dispute resolution. Table 3 quantifies statistical cross-analysis results.
4.2. Model comparisons

Classification schemes used disputed cases (N = 152) for model construction. This work is interested in how dispute resolution was used historically while controlling the parameters of project characteristics. Evaluation analyses were performed using the aforementioned cross-fold validation method. In each model experiment, nine folds of original data were used to train the model for each AI method. The test dataset (the remaining fold of data) was then applied to identify the best classification method. Experiments were run ten times until each fold was used as a test set.

Dispute classification models were constructed with a set of known project attributes (Table 1). The 5-by-5 coincident matrices (rows list actual attribute labels and columns list predictions) for individual models were utilized to calculate model performance in terms of percentage of records predicted correctly by the model relative to the total number of records among classification models. Table 4 lists experimental parameters, and Table 5 shows modeling performance using the baseline model (SVMs) and the hybridization of AI (i.e., the SVMs + fmGA model, and the SVMs + fmGA + FL model; notably, FL cannot be employed alone with SVMs).

Specifically, the best cross-fold training model was the SVMs + fmGA + FL model, which achieved an average accuracy of 98.68% (Fig. 9). The average accuracy improvement was only 2% when compared to that of the SVMs + fmGA model, and was 66.66% when compared to that of the baseline model (i.e., SVMs). This analytical finding demonstrates the efficiency and advantage of integrating AI techniques for dispute classification. Notably, hybridization of one AI technique with SVMs was sufficiently efficient in the classification training model.

Similarly, experimental analyses demonstrate that the hybrid models had the best accuracy for test data (Fig. 10). The SVMs + fmGA + FL model was best in classifying project dispute resolutions with an average cross-fold accuracy of 77.04%, significantly better than that of chance. Specifically, the improvement was 24.76% when compared with that of the baseline model (i.e., SVMs). When comparing the SVMs + fmGA model and the SVMs model, improvement reduced to 12.08%, smaller than that of the SVMs + fmGA + FL model. Therefore, in terms of test results, applying the difficult and time-consuming SVMs + fmGA + FL model is worthwhile, as its prediction performance is reliably superior according to cross-fold validation results.

5. Conclusions

This work assesses the efficacy of hybrid AI techniques in classifying project dispute resolutions. Specifically, one AI technique integrated with SVMs had sufficient training accuracy compared with that of two AI techniques with SVMs. This work demonstrates that an appropriate combination of AI can improve classification testing performance significantly, even though the hybrid system may more difficult and time consuming than other systems. In terms of the cross-fold accuracy with test data, the best hybrid system was generated by combining an fmGA, FL, and SVMs. Fuzzy logic was used to address vagueness and approximate reasoning; SVMs were applied to map fuzzy input–output functions; and the fmGA was utilized as an optimization tool to handle FL and SVMs search parameters.

The experimental models were examined using a real CM domain problem. With known project attributes of disputed cases, the hybrid models exhibited their superiority, stability, efficiency, and ability to avoid overfitting with better accuracy than the single flat SVMs model. A 12.08% improvement was achieved with one additional AI technique combined with SVMs, while the improvement was 24.76% with two AI techniques. In terms of practical application, the advantages of an early warning system for dispute resolutions include reducing the time and effort needed to prepare a rule set to prevent potential disputes by enhancing project understanding among parties. Future work can investigate the improvement achieved by testing other real prediction or classification problems in CM using the proposed hybrid system.
