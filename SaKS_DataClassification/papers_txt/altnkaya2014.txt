Artificial neural network application for modeling the rail rolling process

Abstract

Rail rolling process is one of the most complicated hot rolling processes. Evaluating the effects of parametric values on this complex process is only possible through modeling. In this study, the production parameters of different types of rails in the rail rolling processes were modeled with an artificial neural network (ANN), and it was aimed to obtain optimum parameter values for a different type of rail. For this purpose, the data from the Rail and Profile Rolling Mill in Kardemir Iron & Steel Works Co. (Karabük, Turkey) were used. BD1, BD2, and Tandem are three main parts of the rolling mill, and in order to obtain the force values of the 49 kg/m rail in each pass for the BD1 and BD2 sections, the force and torque values for the Tandem section, parameter values of 60, 54, 46, and 33 kg/m type rails were used. Comparing the results obtained from the ANN model and the actual field data demonstrated that force and torque values were obtained with acceptable error rates. The results of the present study demonstrated that ANN is an effective and reliable method to acquire data required for producing a new rail, and concerning the rail production process, it provides a productive way for accurate and fast decision making.

1. Introduction

The iron and steel industry is among the largest sectors in the world in terms of product diversity, production amounts, market demand, and revenues. Rolling and plastic forming are very important processes in the iron and steel industry. In order to obtain all-round quality results from rolling systems, it is critical to adjust rolling parameters in the optimum way. It is known that parameters such as rolling speed, rolling force, rolling temperature, and friction coefficient are determinative parameters in the rolling processes depending on the material to be rolled as well as on the desired geometry.

In the studies conducted on the optimization, modeling and simulation of rolling systems, usually only one or a few parameters of the system such as the chemical composition of the material, effect of rolling force, heat distribution and extraction of deformation zone, have become focus of researcher, and the number of the studies that considers the system as a whole and take into consideration all its parameters is fairly limited.

Usually the symbolic (mathematical) model among the models categorized in three classes (Turban, Aranson, & Liang, 2005) (Iconic Model, Analogous Model and Symbolic Model) is used for modeling rolling systems. A review of the literature revealed that the most commonly used method in the analysis, simulation and optimization of hot rolling and rail rolling systems is the finite elements method (FEM) (Guerrero, Belzunce, & Jorge, 2009; Kawalla, Graf, & Tokmakov, 2010; Yang-gang, Wen-zhi, & Hui, 2008; Yang-gang, Wen-zhi, & Iian-feng, 2010). The upper bound, least squares and storey regression methods are generally used. Although the artificial intelligence techniques such as artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic are not used as commonly as FEM, still their use – either by themselves or in combination with FEM- has been considerable. On the other hand, until this study, no studies have been come across on the rail rolling process with the use of ANN in the literature.

Some of the studies conducted on the hot rolling processes with the use of ANN are presented below.

Cser et al. have studied a new concept of status monitoring the hot rolling. The authors have proposed a status monitoring based on a detailed analysis of all factors and designed the system to signal when the system status exceeds the required quality interval. In the study, the SOM (Self Organizing Maps) algorithm of ANN was used. This algorithm was found suitable for the highly complicated hot rolling analysis. This algorithm was found to be suitable for the analysis of very complicated hot rolling processes. They have proved that the SOM application is helpful for identifying the secret connections among the factors affecting quality such as smoothness, shape, and density (Cser et al., 1999).

Martinetz et al. have demonstrated how material and energy savings can be achieved in the hot rolling process with the use of ANN, and that ANNs can be used in the optimization of rolling parameters. In the studies conducted with the data obtained from one hundred thousand strip profiles, the authors reported through a table that improvements up to 28% in the RMS errors of rolling force are achieved through the ANN approach (Martinetz, Protzel, Gramckow, & Sörgel, 1994).

Shahani et al. have carried out the simulation and ANN modeling of AA5083 aluminum alloy hot rolling process, and compared the results they obtained from the simulation and ANN in the estimation of the parameters that are effective on the process. The authors carried out the simulation with the use of FEM. For the establishment of the model geometric shape of slab, rolling load, rolling speed, reduction rate, initial thickness of the plate and friction coefficient were used. Graphs of the temperature distribution and stress on the deformation area were obtained separately through FEM and ANN, and it was demonstrated that the results were mostly consistent with each other. The authors used the results they obtained from FEM as the input data of ANN. Twenty-five samples were used for training the network, and the data concerning friction coefficient, speed, reduction rate and initial temperature were determined as input parameters. The authors used twelve samples for test purposes. For the training of the network, back propagation rule was used (Shahani, Setayeshi, Nodamaie, Asadi, & Rezaie, 2009).

Öznergiz et al. have compared experimental and ANN modeling of the hot rolling process. By establishing an experimental model, the authors have aimed to accurately obtain the values of parameters of the rolling force, torque and slab temperature, and then demonstrated that the same parameter values can also be obtained through ANN. The authors have obtained the data they used from the 2nd hot rolling mill in Öznergiz, Delice, Özsoy, and Kural (2009).

Barrios et al. have designed several artificial neural networks, nerve-based Grey-Box models, fuzzy inference systems and fuzzy-based Grey-Box models in order to estimate input temperature in a hot strip rolling mill and tested these with experimental data (Barrios, Alvarado, & Cavazos, 2012).

Rolle et al. have modeled a new hybrid system by combining artificial neural networks with PID control in order to enhance the performance of steel rolling process (Rolle, Roca, Quintian, & Lopez, 2013).

In the present study it was aimed to obtain the parameter values required to produce a new type of rail by modeling the rail production process in Turkey’s only rail producing facility, Kardemir Rail and Profile Rolling Mill using an artificial neural network.
2. Rolling

A general definition of rolling can be given as forming a material plastically (permanently) using a mould. The process of rolling is primarily related to the rolling of metals.

Transforming metallic materials into long or flat products is carried out by rolling them via moulds that are referred to as rolls. The largest part of giving plastic form to a material is made through rolling. The material to be shaped is passed through two or more rolls that rotate at opposite directions and thus resized. The primary objective in rolling is to compress the material, or in other words to make it denser. The secondary objective is to transform the material into a smaller profile (Hanoğlu & Sarler, 2009; Lenard, Pietrzyk, & Cser, 1999; The University of Sheffild, 2003; Wusatowski, 1969).

During the rolling operation, the rolls (cylinders) rotate at the same speed in opposite directions. The desired form is given to the materials, while they pass through the rollers. Since the gap between the rolls is smaller than the initial thickness of the material, the exit thickness of the rolled material is smaller than its initial thickness. In other words, the thickness of the rolled material is reduced. Each time the material that passes through the rollers is called a pass. Rolling is an indirect mechanical pressing process, and generally the only force applied is the radial pressure created by the rollers (Fig. 1).

While rolling conducted at a temperature below recrystallization temperature is referred to as cold rolling, operations carried out at higher temperatures are called hot rolling.

Hot rolling is related to the form and geometry of the material rather than its mechanical properties. This is carried out by heating a piece or material beyond its critical temperature and then by applying a controlled load that will shape the material into the desired size and form. In each pass, the stock (work piece) cross-section is reshaped and reduced. The shapes that are carved on the surface of the roll are called groove, and when two rolls come face to face, the shape that occurs is named as a pass (Figs. 2 and 3).

By means of hot rolling, products such as squares, circulars, flats, polygonal, and strips, T, I, U, and H profiles, and rails are produced. As the entry material of the system, semi-finished products such as slab, bloom, beam blank and billet are used.
3. Rail rolling process

At the rolling mill, 260 × 360 mm blooms are charged into the furnace and annealed. In order to clear off the scale layer formed on the tempered products, the material at first passes through the scale cleaning unit that applies water with 250 bar pressure, then goes through the BD1 section where the symmetric rolling is carried out, and box passes are used, then through the BD2 section where the asymmetric rolling is conducted, and grooves (calibres) of varying geometrical shapes are used, and finally through the Tandem rolling, the group of rollers operates in-between very tight tolerances through computer control for the top level achievement of sensitivity of geometry, and thus the material is turned into the desired product by being rolled at four directions horizontally and vertically.

The complete layout of the rail rolling process is shown in Fig. 4. There are 7 passes in BD1, 5 passes in BD2 and 6 passes in Tandem section. Geometric dimensions and forms of each pass are distinctive. Fig. 5 presents the BD2 groove shapes of five passes of 60 kg/m rail. The rolling of the rail in BD2 and Tandem sections are given in Figs. 6 and 7, while the perspective view of the rail is given in Fig. 8. Figs. 9–11, on the other hand, present the entry and exit geometrical forms and dimensions of 49 kg/m rail for BD1, BD2 and Tandem sections.

After the materials rolled in the Tandem group are cooled by the air fans in the 76 m long cooling bed, they are subjected to straightening process on horizontal and vertical straighteners in the production line. After the profiles coming out of the straighteners are cut at the desired dimensions in the profile line, they are packed in the packaging unit and supplied to the market.

In the rail production, on the other hand, the rails passing though the straightening unit are sent to the test centre to be subjected to ultrasonographic examination and to surface screening system for detecting possible micro cracks in their internal structure and surface defects.

After the test centre, the rails are passed through the gag press bench in order to rectify any skew that may occur at the ends of the rails before being presented into the drilling and cutting unit. By being cut at the standard 72, 36, 24, 18 and 12 m lengths or with custom lengths in the cutting machine running at the end of the rail line, the rails are sent to dispatch. Fig. 3 presents the entry and exit geometrical forms and dimensions of 49 kg/m rail throughout the production process.
4. Mathematical bases of the hot rolling process

There are several approaches used for calculating rolling force in hot rolling. These approaches are developed to determine through several tests – the rolling force with minimum error. Obtained formulas are generally used for strip, flat and plate materials. The theoretical pressure distribution occurs during hot rolling, and accordingly the whole rolling force is obtained with the following formula (Wusatowski, 1969).
(1)
where P is the rolling force, R is the roll radius, γ is the rolling angle, φ is the bite angle, σ is the normal stress that occurs perpendicularly to the rolling direction in consequence of the normal stress at radial direction between the rolled material and the roller. This formula is used to sensitively calculate pressure distribution. For the rolling process of flat profiles between equal dimension rollers, typically the following formula is used:
(2)
where P is the rolling force that occurs due to the pressure applied by the rolled material to the rollers, b is the width of rolling stock (mm), ld is the length of contact between the rolls and rolling stock, k is the flow strength, and Qp is a geometrical factor.
(3)
ld is signified as shown above. Here, while R is the radius of the rolls, Δh is the reduction rate. Celikow, Glowin, Samarin, Orowan, Pascoe, Sims and Ekelund proposed different equations for calculating the geometrical factor Qp, based on their own experimental rolling data. Here only Sims’ and Ekelund’s equations will be provided without going into details. According to Sims (Hanoğlu & Sarler, 2009; Wusatowski, 1969):
(4)
where hnp is the thickness at the neutral point as seen in Fig. 12, r (Δh) is the reduction (hentry − hexit). And the symbol R′ is given by
(5)

where R′ is the flattened but still circular roll radius, R is the original roll radius, v is the Poisson’s ratio, E is the Young’s modulus of the roll in Pa, and Pr is the roll separating force, as shown in Fig. 12.

According to Ekelund (Wusatowski, 1969):
(6)

For rail and profile rolling processes, these formulas will be much more complex. In the limited number of studies conducted on rail rolling, which is a non-linear and complex process, researchers proposed some formulas for force on the basis of their own experimental data. Here, only the formula for the force on the horizontal roller in the Tandem section will be provided (Yang-gang et al., 2010).
(7)

where, Ph is the rolling force acting on the horizontal roll, Rh is the radius of horizontal roll, Vh is the length of deformation zone between horizontal roll and web of rail, ψh is the neutral angle of the horizontal roll, Nx is the power consumed on the discontinuity various surface of plastic deformation region.
5. Artificial neural network

Today, the artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the most commonly used artificial intelligence techniques being applied to several areas. Artificial intelligence is defined as a computer’s or a computer controlled machine’s skills pertaining to advanced mental processes such as reasoning, inferring, generalization and learning from past experiences, which are usually assumed to be human-specific. There are many artificial intelligence techniques being used such as artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms.

ANN is the computer-aided modeling technique developed for the purpose of automatically performing human brain-peculiar skills such as deriving new information by learning, creating and discovering new information. Conducting these skills by traditional programming methods are often very difficult or impossible. Therefore, it is possible to assert that artificial neural networks are a computer related science focusing on adaptive information processing developed by the events that are very difficult or impossible to program.

ANNs are used with success in topics such as learning, association, classification, generalization, determining features and optimization. By means of this technique, the networks’ own experiences are created through the information obtained from samples, and the networks are enabled to give similar decisions in similar topics. Technically, the primary task of an ANN is to determine a set of outputs that meet the set of inputs submitted to it.

ANNs consist of artificial neural neurons. Generally, the neurons convene in three layers and constitute the network. These layers are the input, hidden and output layers (Fig. 13). In the input layer, the inputs received from the outer world are sent to the intermediate layer. Each process element has only one output. This output is sent to all process elements in the next layer. In intermediate layer(s), the information received from the input layer is processed and transferred to the next layer. There may be more than one intermediate layer and more than one process in each layer. In the output layer, the data obtained from the intermediate layers are processed, and the outputs generated by the network are sent to the outer world (Nabiyev, 2005; Öztemel, 2003).

Fig. 13. General structure of ANN.

The topology that is formed in consequence of the connection of process elements in an ANN, the summing and activation functions of the process elements, learning strategies and the utilized rule of learning determine the model of the network. Today the commonly used models are: multilayer perceptrons (MLP), vector quantization models (VQM), self-organizing models (SOM), adaptive resonance theory models (ART), Hopfield networks, counter propagation networks, neocognitron networks, Boltzman machine, probabilistic networks (PNN), Elman networks, and radial basis networks (RBN).

Artificial neural networks have nerve cells just as biologic neural networks have. Artificial neurons are also called process elements. Each process element has five primary elements. These are input, weight, summing function, activation function and the output of the neuron. Inputs are information received by an artificial neuron from the outer world, from other neurons or from itself. Weights that indicate importance and effect of the data reaching a neuron can be variable or fixed values. Summing function calculates the net input reaching a cell. There are different functions used for this. However, the most common one is to find the weighted sum. Activation function processes the net input received by the neuron and determines the output the neuron generates in return for this input. Although there are several activation functions used, usually sigmoid function is used in the multilayer perceptron model. This function is expressed as follows.
(8)

Output of the neuron is the output value determined by the activation function. Generated output can be sent to the outer world, to another neuron or to itself. After an ANN is established, training and testing phases start. That means that for an ANN, two datasets are needed. These are training datasets and the test dataset. During the training, the outputs desired to be obtained are introduced to the network. At first, bias and weights are selected randomly, and the weights are updated until the desired outputs are generated. While the weights are insignificant and random before the training, after the training they bear significant information. When the performance reaches a satisfactory level the training stops and the network makes decision on the basis of weights. Using more training data do not always mean that better results will be obtained. Numbers of training and test data are determined by experience according to the type of the problem. For instance, the weights and biases for the thirty pass in the BD1 are given in Table 7.

The errors that occur during the training and test phases are referred to as root mean squares errors (RMSE):
(9)
In addition, absolute fraction of variance (R2) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are given as follow respectively (Canakci, Ozsezen, Arcaklioglu, & Erdil, 2009; Koca, Oztop, Varol, & Koca, 2011; Ozgoren, Bilgili, & Sahin, 2012; Sözen, Arca, & Menlik, 2010):
(10)
(11)

where, t is the target value, o is the output value, and n is the number of pattern. RMSEs, R2s and MAPEs are given in Tables 8–11 for the BD1, BD2 and Tandem respectively. After the training of the network, the test dataset that has not been used in training is applied to the network and the results are evaluated.
6. Use of artificial neural network for the estimation of rail rolling parameters

For the application of ANN, five parameters among the production parameters of five types of rails in the production portfolio of Kardemir Rail and Profile Rolling Mill were selected as input, while two were separately selected as output. For each pass, the parameters of cross section area, reduction rate r (Δh), rail type, speed, and temperature were selected as the input parameters, while torque and force, as one of the most important parameters of rolling process, were selected as the output parameters. These input and output parameters were determined by evaluating physical model and mathematical approaches of the rail rolling process. Data of the 60, 54 and 49 kg/m types of rails were obtained from both pass schedule and actual field databases. Data of the rail types 46 and 33 kg/m on the other hand were obtained only from pass schedule databases. Design parameters of pass schedules data were defined by the company that established the rolling mill. As a sample, the pass schedule of the 46 kg/m rail for BD1 section is given in Table 1, and the actual force and temperature data samples taken from the rolling mill are also given in Fig. 14.

For learning rule, the feed-forward back-propagation method was selected. Number of iterations was determined to be optimum 100. All data were normalized in the way to have values between the range of 0.1 and 0.9. The following formula was used for normalization.

here, while VN is the normalized value, V is the original value, Vmin is the minimum value and Vmax is the maximum value. As for determining the original value from the normalized value, the following formula was used

It was observed that among different algorithms and numbers of intermediate layers, the best results were obtained from the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) algorithm with two hidden layers. Purelin (linear transfer function) and radbas (radial basis transfer function) were selected as the transfer functions and similar results were obtained from these two functions. The artificial neural network was established in the MATLAB software.

Literature does not have an agreed rule for the determination of the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in these layers. However, there have been some approaches proposed by researchers. (Huang & Babri, 1998; Huang & Huang, 1991; Karsoliya, 2012; Khaw, Lim, & Lim, 1994; Panchal, Ganatra, Kosta, & Panchal, 2011):

From the ANNs established with varying architectures, the artificial neural network architecture that provided the best results and that had two hidden layers with 8 neurons in the first layer and 3 neurons in the second layer was used (Figs. 15 and 16).

For each pass, 35 data were used for training of network, while 5 data were used for the test. In total, 630 data were used for training and 90 data for the test.

When training multilayer networks in MATLAB environment, the general practice is to first divide the data into three subsets. The first subset is the training set, which is used for computing the gradient and updating the network weights and biases. The second subset is the validation set. The error on the validation set is monitored during the training process. The validation error normally decreases during the initial phase of training, as does the training set error. However, when the network begins to overfit the data, the error on the validation set typically begins to rise. The network weights and biases are saved at the minimum of the validation set error. The test set error is not used during the training, but it is used to compare different models (Beale, Hagan, & Demuth, 2013).

Tables 4 and 5 present the pass schedule, actual force values and the force values found with ANN for sections BD1 and BD2. Table 6, on the other hand, presents pass schedule, actual and ANN force and torque values for the Tandem section. It was considered sufficient to find the torque values only for the Tandem section, which is the most sensitive part of rolling processes.

In Tables 4–6, when actual values and ANN-derived values were compared, the error rates of force values for 7 passes in BD1 section were 0.86%, 9.94%, 2%, 5.06%, 3.65%, 9.45%, and 3.03%, respectively; for 5 passes in BD2 section, the error rates are 3.67%, 3.62%, 4.18%, 4.36% and 9.95%, respectively; for 6 passes in Tandem section, the error rates are 6.72%, 6.33%, 4.90%, 3.52%, 3.54% and 2.94%, respectively. The error rates for torque values in Tandem section are 6.33%, 1.05%, 3.23%, 1.57%, 4.91% and 5%, respectively. These results indicate that ANN can be used successfully for system modeling. ANN produced force and torque values with less error rates in 5 out of 7 passes in BD1 section, in 4 out of 5 passes in BD2 section, and in 5 out of 6 passes in Tandem section. The underlying cause of higher error rates in certain passes is the complexity of the process, and potential measurement errors.

When the tables are examined, it is observed that in all passes, the error rates are less than 10%. Figs. 18–20 displayed graphically the force values of the BD1, BD2 and Tandem respectively. Fig. 21 also shows the torque values of Tandem.

Tables 8–11 show statistical values for ANN output of each pass in BD1, BD2, and Tandem sections for training and test data. Each error value for ANN outputs are presented in the tables. When MAPE test values are considered, it exceeds 10% in 2 passes in BD1 section (2nd and 6th passes), whereas it is less than 10% in the remaining passes. MAPE values in BD2 section exceed 10% in one pass (5th pass), and are less than 10% in remaining passes. On the other hand, MAPE values are less than 10% in all passes in Tandem section. In BD1 section, the mean MAPE test value for 7 passes is 8.167383%; in BD2 section, the mean MAPE test value for 5 passes is 8.151779%; in Tandem section, the mean MAPE test value for the force parameter of 6 passes is 5.910424%, and the mean MAPE test value for torque is 3.433603%. We believe that considerably higher error rates in certain passes in BD1 and BD2 sections result from the complexity of the process, and potential measurement errors. The reason for lower error rate in Tandem section compared to BD1 and BD2 is the use of more experimental (actual) data in this section. RMS values are extremely low for all passes. R2 values are generally close to each other, and 1. Tables 8–11 clearly indicates that the ANN model is being represented by very accurate statistical values at all stages of the process, and can predict ANN force and torque values.

7. Conclusions

The current study revealed that by using the production parameters of four different types of rails (60, 54, 46 and 33 kg/m), the parameter values of a new type of rail (49 kg/m) can be obtained by modeling with ANN. Comparing the results obtained from ANN and the production values to determine the torque and force values of 49 kg/m rail showed that the error rates in all passes are below 10%. It was demonstrated that by modeling the production parameter values of present rails with ANN, the important parameter values required for the production of a new (different) type of rail can be obtained. The low rates of error indicate the reliability of the model. It was observed that the selections made in the determination of input parameters for accurately calculating the force and torque values accepted as output parameters are significantly effective on the results. It was also observed that using the normalized data and actual field data enable researchers to obtain better results.

This study showed clearly that instead of using complex approaches and analytical equations, ANNs can be used to determine parameter values required for product design in the rail rolling process. In addition, in an extremely complicated and expensive system such as rail rolling, it is possible to simulate a new product by using ANN, without causing time and financial loss.

Rail rolling process is one of the most complicated rolling processes. Therefore it is difficult to introduce mathematical model with high accuracy for the process. In present study it is shown that ANN algorithm can be used as an alternative method in modeling and simulation of the process.

For future studies, ANN algorithm can be integrated with the process of designing intermediate passes by evaluating force and torque values. Considering the parameters which can be changed in real time operation such as Δh, area, temperature, ANN algorithm can be implemented for online simulation of rail rolling process. It is also possible to investigate applicability of using this model in the real time control systems.
