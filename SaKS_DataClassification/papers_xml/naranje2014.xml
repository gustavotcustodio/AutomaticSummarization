  <section name="Introduction">
    <sentence>Deep drawing is one of the typical sheet metal forming process used to produce axisymmetric and irregular hollow shapes through combined action of tensile and compressive deformation.</sentence>
    <sentence>Design of deep drawing die is a highly specialized task.</sentence>
    <sentence>It includes number of important activities that sequential start with determination of blank size, manufacturability assessment of deep drawn parts, selection of process parameters, determination of process sequence, selection/design of die components, and modeling of die components and die assembly.</sentence>
    <sentence>Traditionally, these tasks are carried out by skilled die designers and process planners using experience-based trial-and-error procedure (Sitaraman, Kinzel, &amp; Altan, 1991; Tisza &amp; Racz, 1991).</sentence>
    <sentence>Traditional design process of a deep drawing die is manual, tedious, time consuming and error-prone, which results in high cost and long manufacturing lead time of deep drawn parts (Sing &amp; Rao, 1997).</sentence>
    <sentence>Therefore automated design of deep drawing die has become a challenge for researchers.</sentence>

    <sentence>and progressive dies.</sentence>
    <sentence>Today, some commercial software packages (UG, CATIA, SolidWorks etc.)</sentence>
    <sentence>having special die design modules are available in the market.</sentence>
    <sentence>Also there are some dedicated CAD applications available in the market developed on platform of commercial software, like 3D-QuickStrip, Logopress3 developed on SolidWorks platform, and VAMOS CAA V5 progressive die on CATIA platform.</sentence>
    <sentence>Experienced die designers are using these softwares for various activities of die design process such as flat pattern development, nesting of parts, blank layout and generation of drawing of strip layout, mainly for shearing and bending operations.</sentence>
    <sentence>However, most of these softwares provide a vertical solution for die design and their applicability is also restricted to limited part geometries.</sentence>
    <sentence>Hence, users are not satisfied with these existing solutions.</sentence>
    <sentence>Further, die designers have to use multiple software packages for various activities of die design process and connectivity between these softwares is mostly non-existent.</sentence>
    <sentence>Well trained, competent and experienced persons are required to operate these softwares and interpret the results.</sentence>

    <sentence>The proposed system is capable to automate all major activities of design of deep drawing die; and flexible and has low cost of implementation.</sentence>
  </section>
  <section name="Considerations for design of deep drawing die">
    <sentence>Manufacturability assessments Manufacturability assessment of deep drawn parts is the first important activity of design of deep drawing die.</sentence>
    <sentence>It should be in concurrent with product development, since it helps to identify and resolve potential problems on the part such as splitting and excessive thinning or wrinkling at initial die design process.</sentence>
    <sentence>Higher thickness to diameter ratio is good and it should be at least 1.0 percent.</sentence>
    <sentence>If it is less, then wrinkling may occur.</sentence>
    <sentence>Depth and length of the deep drawn parts must be greater than one half of their diameter.</sentence>
    <sentence>Plastic deformation during deep drawing process must be kept below the strain at the ultimate strength of the material.</sentence>
    <sentence>Sharp radius (inside radius or flange radius) should be avoided.</sentence>
    <sentence>Draw and punch radii should be at least four times of sheet thickness.</sentence>
    <sentence>With a large radius of the drawing die ranging from 8 to 15 times of sheet thickness, smaller values of the severity of the draw coefficient may be used.</sentence>
    <sentence>Subsequently, with smaller drawing die radii such as those ranging from 4 to 8 times of sheet thickness, larger draw coefficient is recommended.</sentence>
    <sentence>When the draw radius is too small, excessive thinning or fracture results at the bottom of a shell and at any stage of the operation.</sentence>
    <sentence>This can be corrected by increasing die radius or blank diameter to allow easier metal flow.</sentence>
    <sentence>Process planning During the process planning, the die designer or process planner has to determine various process parameters such as limiting draw ratio, die radius, punch radius, clearance, punch velocity, type of lubricant etc.</sentence>
    <sentence>These process parameters depend on sheet material, sheet thickness, type of die, accuracy requirement and complexity of part geometry etc.</sentence>
    <sentence>Generally the limiting draw ratio (blank diameter to cup diameter) is taken as 1.8 for aluminum; 1.9 for steel and 2.0 for stainless steel sheet material.</sentence>
    <sentence>Die radius should be four to six times of material thickness for steel and five to ten times for stainless steel and aluminum.</sentence>
    <sentence>Punch radius should be at least four to eight times of material thickness for steel, and eight to ten times for aluminum sheet material.</sentence>
    <sentence>Generally it is recommended that punch-die clearance should be at least 1.10 times of sheet thickness.</sentence>
    <sentence>Experienced process planners recommend that punch velocity should be 0.4 m/s for deep drawing of steel and 0.15–0.2 m/s for stainless steel and aluminum alloys.</sentence>
    <sentence>Lubricants must be checked for compatibility with sheet material.</sentence>
    <sentence>Strip-layout design For design of strip-layout, die designers identify the sheet metal operations required and their proper sequence for production of defect free deep drawn parts.</sentence>
    <sentence>Local features of different types should be produced at separate stations.</sentence>
    <sentence>If there is a hole inside the deep drawing shape, then it should be worked after the deep drawing operation.</sentence>
    <sentence>When two stages are used to lance the strip, there should be minimum 3.0 mm distance between two lance operations.</sentence>
    <sentence>Sequence of operations should be in such a way that all features and tolerances can be controlled.</sentence>
    <sentence>Once the sequence of operations is established, idle stations can be inserted if necessary.</sentence>
    <sentence>Idle stations should be included to strengthen a die and to incorporate future design modifications.</sentence>
    <sentence>The strip width and feed distance depend on the sheet thickness, dimensions of blank and direction of sharp edge of sheet, and number of stations.</sentence>
    <sentence>Selection of die components Selection of die components is a vital step of the design process of a deep drawing die.</sentence>
    <sentence>A deep drawing die consists of several components including die block, punch(es), die gages, strippers, stripper plate, punch plate, back plate, die-set and fasteners.</sentence>
    <sentence>The size of die block depends on sheet thickness, sheet material, direction of sharp edge of strip, strip size, and die material.</sentence>
    <sentence>Dimensions of die gages mainly depend on size of stock strip.</sentence>
    <sentence>It is necessary to maintain a minimum gap of about 5–10 times of sheet thickness between fixed stripper plates and die plate.</sentence>
    <sentence>The size of stripper plate corresponds to the size of die block.</sentence>
    <sentence>Stationary strippers are provided with a milled channel in its bottom surface to accommodate and guide the strip material.</sentence>
    <sentence>The width of channel in the stripper should be equal to the strip width plus adequate clearance to allow for variations in strip width.</sentence>
    <sentence>The height of the channel should be at least equal to 1.5 times of sheet thickness.</sentence>
    <sentence>The thickness of punch plate depends on punch diameter.</sentence>
    <sentence>Length and width of punch plate are usually same as that of die block.</sentence>
    <sentence>Back-up plates are hardened and normally interposed between small perforator punches and punch holder.</sentence>
    <sentence>The backup plate is generally about 10–12 mm thick.</sentence>
    <sentence>A die-set is a unit component constituted of punch holder, die holder, guide post, and guide bush.</sentence>
    <sentence>Die designer needs to determine the type and size of die-set (Waller, 1978).</sentence>
    <sentence>Selection of type of die-set depends on the type of sheet metal operation, part quantity and job accuracy.</sentence>
    <sentence>Dimensions of die-set depend upon the length and width of the die and its placement in the die-set.</sentence>
    <sentence>Die-shoe forms the base of the die-set and in majority of die-sets the guideposts are mounted on it.</sentence>
    <sentence>The die shoe thickness is based on how much force can be expected during cutting and forming operation.</sentence>
    <sentence>The length of guideposts should be sufficient so that it never come out of their bushings during the press operation (Smith, 1990).</sentence>
    <sentence>The guide pins should be 6.5 mm shorter than the shut height of the die.</sentence>
    <sentence>The primary purpose of fasteners is to clamp together all die components in a safe and secure manner.</sentence>
    <sentence>Whenever possible hex-socket head cap type screws should be used.</sentence>
    <sentence>For die sets of greater weight, an additional socket cap screw should be inserted through the upper die shoe to the underside of the ram.</sentence>
    <sentence>Screw head holes must be counter-bored in the die section and screw threads must enter into die components at least 1.5 times of its diameter.</sentence>
    <sentence>To achieve the precise alignment at least two dowels per block are essential and must be press-fitted.</sentence>
    <sentence>The number and size of screws are determined by estimating the space available and the load to be resisted.</sentence>
    <sentence>Generally four Allen bolts are used at the four corners of die block.</sentence>
    <sentence>Modeling of die components and die assembly Modeling of plate elements requires the dimensional data of die block, die gages, stripper plate, punch plate and back plate.</sentence>
    <sentence>For automatic 2-dimensional (2D) modeling of plate elements of deep drawing die, drawing commands of AutoCAD such as LINE, PLINE, CIRCLE, FILLET, LAYER, etc.</sentence>
    <sentence>can be invoked.</sentence>
    <sentence>Similarly, for 3-dimensional (3D) modeling of die components and die assembly in the drawing editor of AutoCAD software, AutoCAD commands such as ORBIT, EXTRUDE, UNION, SUBTRACT, REVOLVES, SWEEPS etc.</sentence>
    <sentence>can be invoked.</sentence>
    <sentence>Based on the above considerations, an automated design system labeled as INTDDD (Intelligent Design of Deep Drawing Die) is developed for design of deep drawing die.</sentence>

    <sentence>Technical knowledge for the development for each module of the proposed system is essentially collected by online and off line consultation with experienced die designers, process planners, and shop floor engineers of different stamping industries.</sentence>
    <sentence>Knowledge is also acquired from published research articles, industry catalogs and manuals of various stamping industries.</sentence>
    <sentence>Production rule based knowledge representation scheme is used to represent the acquired knowledge.</sentence>
    <sentence>The production rules framed for each module are crosschecked from a team of experienced die designers by presenting them IF-condition of the production rule of IF-THEN variety.</sentence>
    <sentence>The framed rules are arranged in a structured manner.</sentence>
    <sentence>The proposed system is implemented on window based operating environment on a PC with hardware configuration as core2 Duo processor with 4 GB RAM and interfaced with AutoCAD software.</sentence>
