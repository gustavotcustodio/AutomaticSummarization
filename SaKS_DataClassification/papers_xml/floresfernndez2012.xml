  <section name="Introduction">
    <sentence>Lung cancer is a public health priority worldwide due to the high mortality rate and the costs involved (Hernández-García, Sáenz-González, &amp; González-Celador, 2010).</sentence>
    <sentence>In 2004, the lung cancer mortality rate in Mexico was approximately 6.49 per 100,000 inhabitants and it has been estimated that about 10,000 people died by this disease in 2010 (Franco-Marina &amp; Villalba-Caloca, 2001; Ruíz-Godoy et al., 2007).</sentence>
    <sentence>Early detection of lung cancer is important for increasing the survival rate, and diverse methods have been used for detecting the disease, such as chest radiography, low-dose computed tomography, sputum cytology and bronchoscopy, among others (Castleberry, Smith, Anderson, Rotter, &amp; Grannis, 2009; Ghosal, Kloer, &amp; Lewis, 2009).</sentence>
    <sentence>However, frequently lung cancer diagnosis is not made opportunely, since detection methods are not sufficiently sensitive and specific (Bajtarevic et al., 2009).</sentence>
    <sentence>Serum biomarkers have been proposed as a complementary method for cancer detection (Fernández et al., 2007).</sentence>
    <sentence>Proteins such as cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA), tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA), cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), progastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), among others, have shown to be potentially useful for diagnosis of lung cancer (Cho, 2007).</sentence>
    <sentence>Nevertheless, they have not provided sufficient specificity and sensitivity when used alone (Bajtarevic et al., 2009).</sentence>
    <sentence>Combining different biomarkers might improve the diagnostic power (Chu et al., 2011; Farlow et al., 2010a, 2010b; Leidinger et al., 2010; Patz et al., 2007), however, identifying an optimal set of biomarkers, which may significantly impact lung cancer detection, is a difficult task.</sentence>
    <sentence>In recent years, artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms have been proposed as auxiliary tools in medicine.</sentence>
    <sentence>Fuzzy logic could increase the sensitivity and specificity of biomarkers for lung cancer (Schneider, Bitterlich, Kotschy-Lang, Raab, &amp; Hans-Joachim, 2007; Schneider et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2003; Zhang, Zhou, Liu, &amp; Harrington, 2006), whereas ANNs may play an important role in lung cancer, in morphologically differentiating malignant from benign cells (Zhou, Jiang, Yang, &amp; Chen, 2002) and in detection of pulmonary nodules from computed tomography chest images (Gomathi &amp; Thangaraj, 2010).</sentence>
    <sentence>More recently, ANNs were used to discriminate between clinical stage I and IV in melanoma (Lancashire et al., 2005), and to discriminate lung cancer from benign lung disease using ANN with six serum tumor markers and 19 parameters of basic information from patients (Feng, Wu, Wu, Nie, &amp; Ni, 2011; Wu et al., 2011).</sentence>
    <sentence>In this study, we selected an assortment of biomarkers from literature, which previously demonstrated diagnostic or prognostic value for lung cancer, and applied a combination of multivariate analysis tools with ANNs modeling in order to find an optimal and minimum panel of biomarkers to discriminate lung cancer patients from high-risk people .</sentence>

  <section name="Materials and methods">
    <sentence>Patient populations 150 subjects were enrolled from Antiguo Hospital Civil de Guadalajara and Centro Oncológico Estatal ISSEMyM, and divided in two groups.</sentence>
    <sentence>The first group included 63 consecutive lung cancer patients (37 men, 26 women) with newly diagnosed lung cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>The second group was composed of patients at high risk for developing lung cancer but with no history of lung disease -- 58 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients (40 men, 18 women) and 29 current smokers (17 men, 12 women) with no history of lung disease.</sentence>
    <sentence>Approval was obtained from the corresponding ethics committee and all participants gave written informed consent.</sentence>
    <sentence>Histological diagnosis of primary lung cancer was established according to the revised classification of lung tumors of the World Health Organization and the International Association for Lung Cancer Study (Travis, Brambilla, Mueller-Hermelink, &amp; Harris, 2004).</sentence>
    <sentence>In accordance with current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines, COPD was defined by a post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.70.</sentence>
    <sentence>Samples and health information were labeled using unique identifiers to protect subject confidentiality.</sentence>
    <sentence>Measurement of serum biomarker concentrations Ten ml of blood from each patient were collected in serum separator tubes, processed immediately and separated by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm at room temperature for 10 min.</sentence>
    <sentence>The separated serum was then aliquoted and stored at −70 °C for future analysis.</sentence>
    <sentence>Fourteen biomarkers which had previously been associated with lung cancer were chosen.</sentence>
    <sentence>Levels of Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1), Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9; R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), Transferrin (TF), α1-Antitrypsin (AT), Haptoglobulin (HPT), Apolipoprotein A-I (APOAI), Retinol-binding protein (RBP), C-reactive protein (CRP; ASSAYPRO, St. Charles, MO), Cancer antigen 125 (CA125), Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), Neuron-specific enolase (NSE; ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH), Cytokeratin 19 fragment (Cyfra 21-1; DRG Instruments GmbH, Germany), and YKL40 (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA) were measured in serum samples with a solid phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using commercially available human ELISA assays and in accordance with the kits’ directions.</sentence>
    <sentence>The absorbance specified in the protocols was measured by an automatic ELISA reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA).</sentence>
    <sentence>Results were converted from the mean absorbance of duplicate wells after subtraction of background values.</sentence>
    <sentence>Recombinant human MMP1, MMP9, CA125, CEA, NSE, Cyfra 21-1, YKL40, uPA, HPT, TF, CRP, APOAI, RBP and AT proteins were used as standards.</sentence>
    <sentence>The standard curve was prepared simultaneously with the test samples.</sentence>
    <sentence>Statistical analysis Differences between groups were calculated by means of a nonparametric test (Mann–Whitney’s U-test).</sentence>
    <sentence>Values of p &lt; 0.05 were considered significant.</sentence>
    <sentence>Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat 8.0.</sentence>
    <sentence>Artificial neural network (ANN) modeling ANNs are tools of artificial intelligence intended to imitate the complex operation of organizing and processing information of the neurons in the brain.</sentence>
    <sentence>ANNs can identify patterns that correlate strongly a set of data which correspond to a class by a learning process, in which interneuron connection weights are used to store knowledge about specific features identified within the data (Lancashire et al., 2005).</sentence>
    <sentence>A common ANN is the Multilayered Perceptron (MLP) which is composed of three layers as shown in Fig 1.</sentence>
    <sentence>The ANN is trained entering information from the input layer through the hidden and output layers of the network.</sentence>
    <sentence>The hidden and output layers are trasformed by a validation function f(θ) that could be the heaviside step, linear, sigmoidal, hyperbolic tangent, among others.</sentence>
    <sentence>The value of the output is compared with a known target vector and the difference is computed as an error.</sentence>
    <sentence>If the output is different than the target vector then the connection weights (Wij, Wik) are readjusted backwards by means of a backpropagation training algorithm which minimizes the error.</sentence>
    <sentence>The procedure is repeated until the output of the ANN reaches a desired error value.</sentence>
    <sentence>It is not the aim of an ANN to perfectly represent the data used during the training set but to extract relevant information which allows modeling different conditions not used during the training process.</sentence>
    <sentence>The functionality of the trained ANN is validated by passing data not used during the training.</sentence>
    <sentence>The software used for training the ANN was Matlab 7.9 and the Neural Networks Toolbox 7.9.</sentence>
    <sentence>Structure for the Multilayer Perceptron network used to classify lung cancer… Fig 1.</sentence>
    <sentence>Structure for the Multilayer Perceptron network used to classify lung cancer patients and controls with biomarker as input of the ANN.</sentence>
    <sentence>Preprocessing: The 14 marker values from all subjects were preprocessed before being used as inputs to the ANN.</sentence>
    <sentence>The funcion “mapstd” was used to normalize marker values to a mean value 0 with a standard deviation of 1.</sentence>
    <sentence>Training: From previous results where different ANNs were tested (data not shown), it was determined that the pattern recognition network (PRN) might be used for classifying lung cancer and control patients (Flores et al., 2011).</sentence>
    <sentence>A PRN is a feedforward network trained to classify inputs according to target classes.</sentence>
    <sentence>In order to determine the best architecture for the PRN, structures with one hidden layer (with 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15 and 20 nodes) and two hidden layers (with 3–2, 5–3, 2–6, 6–3 and 5–5 nodes) were tested.</sentence>
    <sentence>Two neurons were set in the output layer, representing cancer patients and control subjects, respectively.</sentence>
    <sentence>The optimal architecture was chosen as the one resulting with the lowest training error.</sentence>
    <sentence>The nonlinear tangential sigmoidal activation function for the hidden neurons was “tansig” while the linear activation function for the output neurons was “purelin” in the range 0 to 1.</sentence>
    <sentence>The PRN was trained with the algorithm “trainrp”.</sentence>
    <sentence>The stopping criterion was set as the mean squared error (MSE) less than 0.09, where (1) and t is the target vector, θ is the output of the ANN and N is the amount of data.</sentence>
    <sentence>The whole data set of biomarkers information was randomly divided as follows: 60% for training and 20% for validation; this matrix was used in all the experiments.</sentence>
    <sentence>In addition, 20% of samples not used during training the ANN were used for testing.</sentence>
    <sentence>To avoid over-fitting a 10-fold cross-validation was used.</sentence>
    <sentence>Principal component analysis (PCA) In order to determine uncorrelated biomarkers that better explain the variability observed in the data, a PCA was applied to biomarkers that showed significant differences between groups, by using Simca-P + 12.0TM.</sentence>
    <sentence>The best biomarkers were used to train the ANN.</sentence>
    <sentence>Detection capability comparison The sensitivity of the ANN with the best combination of biomarkers was compared with the best single biomarker by means of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves at a specificity of relevant clinical value (80%).</sentence>
    <sentence>The ROC curves were graphed using SigmaPlotTM 10.0.</sentence>
    <sentence>A p-value &lt; 0.05 (Kolmogorov-Smirnof test) was considered significant.</sentence>
    <sentence>Discriminant analysis To compare the performance of the ANN against multivariate statistics,we used a classical parametric statistical method (linear discriminant analysis, LDA).</sentence>
    <sentence>LDA provides certain linear combinations of the original variables called discriminant functions, which are likely to improve on the discrimination between the groups than any individual variable.</sentence>
    <sentence>LDA was performed using Statgraphics Centurion XV©, which includes stepwise forward and backward, in attempt to simplify the classification model, obtaining the same improvement with both algorithms.</sentence>
    <sentence>The criteria for adding or removing variables from the model was statistical value F. Even though we tried to convert the experimental data, most of them did not present normal distribution, due to the fact that protein concentrations showed large differences within groups.</sentence>
    <sentence>Even standard deviations of the data showed no homogeneity between groups.</sentence>

  <section name="Results">
    <sentence>Analysis of individual serum biomarkers As a first step in the effort to establish a novel multi-analyte serum test for lung cancer detection, we selected an assortment of 14 biomarkers and determined their concentrations in serum from 63 lung cancer patients and 87 control subjects.</sentence>
    <sentence>Table 1 summarizes demographic and clinical characteristics of patients.</sentence>
    <sentence>These groups are not significantly different regarding age and smoking index.</sentence>
    <sentence>Lung cancer patients showed higher serum concentrations of MMP1, MMP9, AT, HPT, CA125, CEA, Cyfra 21-1, NSE, CRP and YKL-40 than controls, whereas concentrations of TF, APOAI and RBP were lower in lung cancer patients, and uPA showed no difference (Table 2).</sentence>

    <sentence>ANN trained with fourteen biomarkers A multilayer pattern recognition ANN that we named ANN1 was trained, validated and tested with 90, 30 and 30 samples, respectively.</sentence>
    <sentence>Each sample contained the Normalized concentration of the whole set of 14 biomarkers (MMP1, MMP9, uPA, TF, AT, HPT, CA125, CEA, Cyfra 21-1, NSE, APOAI, RBP, CRP and YKL40), which were used as inputs for the ANN.</sentence>
    <sentence>It was determined that 10 neurons in the hidden layer and two neurons in the output layer gave the best performance for the ANN1.</sentence>
    <sentence>All trainings were made in triplicate to assure that the best architecture was chosen.</sentence>
    <sentence>A MSE of 0.063 was reached with the optimum structure.</sentence>
    <sentence>Using ANN1, 133 of 150 subjects were classified correctly (including lung cancer patients and control subjects), which represents a coefficient of determination R2 = 92.2% (83/90), 93.3% (28/30) and 73.3% (22/30) for training, validation and testing phases, respectively (Table 3).</sentence>

    <sentence>Reduction in biomarkers number (inputs) and evaluation of the ANN performance Although the performance of ANN1 with 14 biomarkers was acceptable, we explored whether the reduction in the number of biomarkers would affect the ANN performance.</sentence>
    <sentence>Mann–Whitney’s U-test was carried out for all the biomarkers concentrations, determining significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in thirteen biomarkers (10 increased and 3 decreased in lung cancer group, Table 2).</sentence>
    <sentence>Then, a prinicpal components analysis (PCA) was carried out over these biomarkers (the PCA is a multivariate, non-parametric method for extracting relevant information from confusing data sets.</sentence>
    <sentence>The idea behind the PCA was to determine those biomarkers that best represent the majority of lung cancer cases).</sentence>
    <sentence>Fig 2 shows the weight of biomarkers regarding to their principal components.</sentence>
    <sentence>Ten biomarkers have influence on the lung cancer group, however, the subgroup CEA, CA125, MMP9, Cyfra 21-1, YKL40 and CRP clearly have greater influence, since these biomarkers have the largest weights on the first and second components.</sentence>
    <sentence>PCA results show that when these proteins have higher concentration, they tend to belong to the lung cancer group.</sentence>

    <sentence>After the initial vector of 14 biomarkers was reduced to six, a new net named ANN2 was trained with these proteins.</sentence>
    <sentence>A multilayered pattern recognition ANN with 5 neurons in the hidden layer was chosen as the best configuration in classifying patients.</sentence>
    <sentence>The vector previously used for training, validation and testing was applied to the ANN2.</sentence>
    <sentence>This network correctly classified 133 of 150 subjects, which represents a determination coefficient of 86.7% (78/90), 96.7% (29/30) and 86.7% (26/30) for training, validation and testing phases, respectively (Table 3).</sentence>
    <sentence>In this case, decreasing the number of biomarkers did not affect the network performance.</sentence>
    <sentence>Development of an optimized biomarker panel based on ANN modeling Finally, in order to find the most reduced panel, all the 56 possible combinations with the six biomarkers derived from the PCA were used to create different ANNs.</sentence>
    <sentence>From the ANNs tested in this stage, it was determined that the new net named ANN3 with five neurons in the hidden layer and the biomarkers combination Cyfra 21-1, CEA, CA125 and CRP had the best performance.</sentence>
    <sentence>ANN3, trained with 4 biomarkers, correctly classified 135 out of 150 subjects.</sentence>
    <sentence>Thus, ANN3 performed similarly to ANN1 and ANN2.</sentence>
    <sentence>The classification rate was slightly improved since two additional cancer patients were classified correctly.</sentence>
    <sentence>The correct classification rate for patients was 88.9% (80/90), 93.3% (28/30) and 90% (27/30) for training, validation and testing stages, respectively (Table 3).</sentence>
    <sentence>The detection capability of each single biomarker and the performance of the ANNs were evaluated by ROC curves.</sentence>
    <sentence>Cyfra 21-1 was the best single protein in classifying lung cancer with a sensitivity of 76.19% at a specificity of 80%.</sentence>
    <sentence>The ROC curve and the sensitivity at a specificity of 80% for Cyfra 21-1 were compared with the ROC curves resulting from the overall performance from ANN1, ANN2 and ANN3 (Fig 4).</sentence>
    <sentence>ANN1 and ANN2, trained with 14 and 6 markers, respectively, increased the sensitivity by 19.71% (sensitivity 95.9% at specificity 80%) and 13.21% (sensitivity 89.4% at specificity 80%), respectively, whereas ANN3 increased the sensitivity 18.31% (sensitivity 94.5% at specificity 80%) with respect to the best single marker Cyfra 21-1.</sentence>
    <sentence>The area under the curve values for Cyfra 21-1, ANN1, ANN2 and ANN3 were 0.85, 0.934, 0.933 and 0.939, respectively (Fig 4).</sentence>

    <sentence>ANN3 had a superior overall classification rate for lung cancer patients (82.54%) and for high-risk control subjects (96.55%).</sentence>

  <section name="Discussion">
    <sentence>Lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>Despite scientific advances in the lung cancer diagnosis, treatment and prognosis, mortality has not changed for several decades (Patz et al., 2007).</sentence>
    <sentence>Because the disease is asymptomatic in early stages (Lu et al., 2004), over 75% cases are diagnosed when the disease is in an advanced stage, where treatment options are limited and, as a consequence, the survival rate at 5 years is less than 15% (Farlow et al., 2010a).</sentence>
    <sentence>Therefore, detecting lung cancer in early stages, when it is possible to resect the tumor, would achieve healing and thereby reduce mortality.</sentence>
    <sentence>Computed tomography (CT) has been proposed as a screening method for early detection in high-risk populations, due to its high sensitivity in detecting pulmonary nodules (The International Early Lung Cancer Action Program Investigators, 2006).</sentence>
    <sentence>Recently released guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.</sentence>
    <sentence>NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.</sentence>
    <sentence>Lung Cancer Screening.</sentence>
    <sentence>Version 1.2012.</sentence>
    <sentence>Retrieved December (2011) in the United States, strongly recommend the use of low-dose computed tomography screening for select individuals at high risk for the disease.</sentence>
    <sentence>However, CT has a low specificity in that only a small percentage of nodule-positive patients will develop lung cancer, and furthermore, repeated radiation may promote carcinogenesis (Brenner &amp; Hall, 2007; Humphrey, Teutsch, &amp; Johnson, 2004; Swensen et al., 2005).</sentence>
    <sentence>Biological markers that define high-risk patients would enhance diagnostic capabilities and complement imaging studies because they can easily be detected in biological fluids using minimally invasive procedures.</sentence>
    <sentence>However, when used alone they show low sensitivity and specificity because lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease (He et al., 2007; Tureci et al., 2006).</sentence>
    <sentence>Recent reports have shown that simultaneous analysis of biomarkers has the potential to separate lung cancer patients from control subjects (Farlow et al., 2010a; Farlow et al., 2010b; Lee et al., 2011; Leidinger et al., 2010; Patz et al., 2007; Schneider et al., 2002; Zhong et al., 2006).</sentence>
    <sentence>However, it has become clear that a universal biomarker panel does not exist, and optimized panels need to be developed and validated in each population before their application in a clinical setting.</sentence>
    <sentence>For that reason, in the present study we selected an assortment of biomarkers from literature, evaluated their concentrations and applied a combination of PCA with ANN modeling to determine the biomarker combination that best discriminates lung cancer patients from control subjects.</sentence>
    <sentence>ANN1 trained with fourteen biomarkers correctly classified 133 of 150 samples.</sentence>
    <sentence>However, this panel of 14 markers may not be the best option for lung cancer diagnosis, due to the high costs of the test.</sentence>
    <sentence>Therefore, it would be desirable to reduce the number of biomarkers without detriment to the ANN performance.</sentence>
    <sentence>Moreover, as a part of the optimization process, it is important to discard non-informative biomarkers that could perturb the classifier.</sentence>
    <sentence>Applying PCA, the number of biomarkers was reduced from 14 to just 6.</sentence>
    <sentence>ANN2 did not lose accuracy since the eight biomarkers eliminated were redundant in information.</sentence>
    <sentence>Recently, Wu et al.</sentence>
    <sentence>(2011) performed a study in Chinese people, training a Back Propagation network (6, 3 and 1 neurons in the input, hidden and output layer, respectively) with 50 lung cancer patients, 40 benign lung disease patients and 50 normal people.</sentence>
    <sentence>Their ANN had a satisfactory performance with 6 biomarkers (β2-microglobulin, CEA, gastrin, CA125, NSE, soluble interleukin-6 receptor) and three metal ions (Cu2+, Zn2+ and Ca2+), achieving a prediction rate of 85% in the test phase.</sentence>
    <sentence>They used several biomarker numbers (3, 4, 6 and 12) as input for the ANN, and similarly, they concluded that increasing biomarker number to more than 6 did not significantly increase the prediction rate.</sentence>
    <sentence>In a related study, Feng et al.</sentence>
    <sentence>(2011) employed an ANN with the same 6 biomarkers described by Wu et al.</sentence>
    <sentence>(2011), adding 19 parameters with information such as risk factors, symptoms, smoking, chemical exposure, kitchen environment, and so on.</sentence>
    <sentence>This ANN had 25 neurons in the input layer and 15 in the hidden layer.</sentence>
    <sentence>Their ANN reached a prediction rate of 87.3% in the test phase, similar to our results.</sentence>
    <sentence>Taking advantage of the ANN’s capabilities to find the most reduced panel, all the possible combinations with the six biomarkers derived from the PCA were used to create 56 different ANNs.</sentence>
    <sentence>From these, ANN3 with five neurons in the hidden layer and the biomarker combination Cyfra 21-1, CEA, CA125 and CRP presented the best performance.</sentence>
    <sentence>It was found that decreasing the biomarkers to four did not affect the network performance, in fact, two additional patients in the cancer group were correctly classified, perhaps because the other two markers gave redundant information during ANN training.</sentence>
    <sentence>ANN3 had the best sensitivity at a specificity of 80%, compared with the other nets and the best single marker (see Fig 4).</sentence>
    <sentence>On the other hand, ANN3 required fewer markers than needed by discriminant analysis to separate the study groups (four and eight proteins, respectively), which would represent a reduction in costs associated.</sentence>
    <sentence>The robustness of ANN3 might be improved by adding samples from new subjects, while keeping the normalizing criteria to train the network.</sentence>
    <sentence>In addition, clinical information such as age, gender, smoking, nodules, etcetera, could be included to improve the ANN performance.</sentence>
    <sentence>In summary, we presented a strategy based on ANN modeling to find the best biomarker combination to distinguish lung cancer patients from high-risk people.</sentence>
    <sentence>This optimized panel is, however, perfectible and awaits additional markers that enhance its diagnostic accuracy, as well as further consideration for future studies.</sentence>
