    <sentence>Recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence have led to the emergence of expert systems for medical applications.</sentence>
    <sentence>Moreover, in the last few decades computational tools have been designed to improve the experiences and abilities of physicians for making decisions about their patients.</sentence>
    <sentence>Breast cancer is the commonest cancer in women and is the second leading cause of cancer death (Jemal et al., 2003).</sentence>
    <sentence>Although it is curable when detected early, about one third of women with breast cancer die of the disease (Scheidhauer, Walter, &amp; Seemann, 2004).</sentence>
    <sentence>In this study, we have developed an expert system that we called as an Ex-DBC (Expert system for Diagnosis of Breast Cancer), because differentiating between benign and malignant mammographic findings, however, is quite difficult.</sentence>
    <sentence>Only 15–30% of biopsies performed on nonpalpable but mammographically suspicious lesions prove malignant (Hall, Storella, Silverstone, &amp; Wyshak, 1988).</sentence>
    <sentence>The golden standard for diagnosis of breast cancer is biopsy.</sentence>
    <sentence>But, biopsy can be a source of patient discomfort, bleeding and infection, and can burden the health care system with extra costs.</sentence>
    <sentence>Thus, to reduce unnecessary biopsy rate have acquired big importance.</sentence>
    <sentence>The fuzzy rules which will be use in inference engine of Ex-DBC system were found by using neuro-fuzzy method.</sentence>
    <sentence>Ex-DBC can be used as a strong diagnostic tool with 97% specificity, 76% sensitivity, 96% positive and 81% negative predictive values for diagnosing of breast cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>That the developed system’s positive predictive is high is very important.</sentence>
    <sentence>By means of this system can be prevented unnecessary biopsy.</sentence>
    <sentence>Beside it can be benefited from this system for training of students in medicine.</sentence>

  <section name="Introduction">
    <sentence>Among women, the three most commonly diagnosed cancers will be cancers of the breast, lung and bronchus, and colon and rectum.</sentence>
    <sentence>Cancers occurring at these sites are expected to account for about 55 percent of new cancer cases.</sentence>
    <sentence>Breast cancer alone is expected to account for 32 percent (211,300) of all new cancer cases among women in 2003 (Jemal et al., 2003).</sentence>
    <sentence>About one-third of women with breast cancer die of the disease, although it is curable when detected early (Scheidhauer, Walter, &amp; Seemann, 2004).</sentence>
    <sentence>Breast cancers in early stages unfortunately produce no symptoms when the tumor is still small and hence well treatable.</sentence>
    <sentence>Therefore, it is difficult but at the same time important to detect breast cancers at an early stage.</sentence>
    <sentence>Both randomized trials and population-based evaluations of screening mammography have shown that early detection of breast cancer through mammography greatly improves the chances of survival (Humphrey, Helfand, Chan, &amp; Woolf, 2002; Tabar et al., 2001).</sentence>
    <sentence>Mammography can identify cancer several years before physical symptoms are produced and therefore it is recognized as the most effective breast cancer screening method available today.</sentence>
    <sentence>However, about 5–10% of the mammography results are interpreted as abnormal or inconclusive until further examinations like ultrasound imaging or breast biopsy lead to a final interpretation of normal or benign breast tissue.</sentence>
    <sentence>It is reported that only 10–30% of all breast biopsies actually show a malignant pathology (Kopans, 1992).</sentence>
    <sentence>The high number of unnecessary breast biopsies causes major mental and physical discomfort for the patients as well as unnecessary expenses spent for examinations.</sentence>
    <sentence>So, it is necessary to develop successful identification method to recognize the breast cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>Statistical techniques and artificial intelligence techniques have been used to predict the breast cancer by several researchers (Kovalerchuck, Triantaphyllou, Ruiz, &amp; Clayton, 1997; Pendharkar, Rodger, Yaverbaum, Herman, &amp; Benner, 1999).</sentence>
    <sentence>The objective of these identification techniques is to assign patients to either a benign group that does not have breast cancer or a ‘malignant’ group who has strong evidence of having breast cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>So, breast cancer diagnostic problems are more general and widely discussed classification problem (Anderson, 1984; Dillon &amp; Goldstein, 1984; Hand, 1981; Johnson &amp; Wichern, 2002).</sentence>
    <sentence>Motivated by the need of a strong diagnostic tool for breast cancer, in this study, we developed an expert system Ex-DBC to efficiently diagnose the breast cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>The developed system uses fuzzy rules for diagnosis.</sentence>
    <sentence>The remaining of the paper is organized as follows.</sentence>
    <sentence>The following second section gives the necessary background information about data set for breast cancer, used neuro-fuzzy method and expert system.</sentence>
    <sentence>The third section is reserved for explanation of the developed CDDS system Ex-DBC and its components.</sentence>
    <sentence>The fourth section contains issue of diagnostic power of Ex-DBC system.</sentence>
    <sentence>The last section is discussion and conclusion for this study.</sentence>
  </section>
  <section name="Background">
    <sentence>Mammographic mass data set For this study, the mammography mass data set is provided from UCI Machine Learning Repository.</sentence>
    <sentence>This data set can be used to predict the severity (benign or malignant) of a mammographic mass lesion from BI-RADS attributes and the patient’s age.</sentence>
    <sentence>It contains a BI-RADS assessment, the patient’s age and three BI-RADS attributes together with the ground truth (the severity field) for 516 benign and 445 malignant masses that have been identified on full field digital mammograms collected at the Institute of Radiology of the University Erlangen-Nuremberg between 2003 and 2006.</sentence>
    <sentence>Each instance has associated BI-RADS assessment ranging from 1 (definitely benign) to 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy) assigned in a double-review process by physicians.</sentence>
    <sentence>Assuming that all cases with BI-RADS assessments greater or equal a given value (varying from 1 to 5), are malignant and the other cases benign, sensitivities and associated specificities can be calculated.</sentence>
    <sentence>Names and codes of attributes of this data set were given in Table 1.</sentence>
    <sentence>Table 1.</sentence>
    <sentence>Attributes of mammographic mass data.</sentence>
    <sentence>Attribute information BI-RADS BI-RADS assessment: 1–5 (ordinal) Age Age: patient’s age in years (integer) Shape Shape: mass shape: round = 1, oval = 2, lobular = 3, irregular = 4 (nominal) Margin Margin: mass margin: circumscribed = 1, microlobulated = 2, obscured = 3, ill-defined = 4, spiculated = 5 (nominal) Density Density: mass density high = 1, iso = 2, low = 3, fat-containing = 4 (ordinal) Class Severity: benign = 01 or malignant = 10 2.2.</sentence>
    <sentence>Expert system and neuro-fuzzy method An expert system is a computer system which simulates the knowledge and expertise of a human expert.</sentence>
    <sentence>An expert system; • has a large database of knowledge; • allows the database to be interrogated; • has a set of rules (inference engine) for making deductions.</sentence>
    <sentence>For example, in Medicine, expert systems are being used for disease diagnosis.</sentence>
    <sentence>The patient’s details and symptoms are input, and the system outputs probable diagnoses, recommended treatments or drugs which may be prescribed.</sentence>
    <sentence>The advantages of an expert system for doctors; • A large database of knowledge can be added to and kept up-to-date - it can store more knowledge than a person.</sentence>
    <sentence>• The system cannot ’forget’ or get facts wrong.</sentence>
    <sentence>• It survives forever.</sentence>
    <sentence>There is no loss of knowledge as there is when a doctor retires.</sentence>
    <sentence>• The computer can access specialist knowledge that a doctor may not have.</sentence>
    <sentence>In this study, an expert system has been developed which has fuzzy rules obtained by neuro-fuzzy method.</sentence>
    <sentence>Neuro-fuzzy method uses a heuristic learning algorithm whose high performance has been proved in medical diagnosis and classifications (Keles, Haşıloğlı, Keles, &amp; Aksoy, 2007; Keles &amp; Keles, 2008; Nauck, 2003).</sentence>
    <sentence>Thus, Ex-DBC system has a strong inference engine containing fuzzy rules that can detect hidden relations in the case unrecognized by the human expert.</sentence>
    <sentence>Ex-DBC could diagnose with 96% positive and 81% negative predictive values for breast cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>The neuro-fuzzy system has a 3-layer feed-forward architecture that is derived from a generic fuzzy perception (Nauck, Klawonn, &amp; Kruse, 1997).</sentence>
    <sentence>The units in this network use t-norms or t-conorms as activation functions.</sentence>
    <sentence>The hidden layer represents fuzzy rules.</sentence>
    <sentence>Fuzzy sets are encoded as (fuzzy) connection weights.</sentence>
    <sentence>This view of a fuzzy system illustrates the data flow within the system (data and error signals), and its parallel nature.</sentence>
    <sentence>Neuro-fuzzy system as a special three layered feed-forward neural network where • the first layer represents the input variables that means the pattern tuples, • the hidden layer represents fuzzy rules, • the third layer represents the output variables that means one unit for every class, • the units use t-norms and t-conorms as activation functions, • the fuzzy sets are encoded as (fuzzy) connection weights.</sentence>
    <sentence>We investigated best fuzzy model of classification for Mammographic Mass data set.</sentence>
    <sentence>As a result, we obtained best rules to use in inference engine of Ex-DBC system.</sentence>
    <sentence>The neuro-fuzzy model created for Ex-DBC’s inference engine The architecture of model used for this study is shown in Fig 1.</sentence>
    <sentence>The first layer contains three input units representing the pattern features.</sentence>
    <sentence>The hidden layer holds rule units representing the fuzzy rules, and the third layer consists of two output units.</sentence>
    <sentence>In this study, the hidden layer contains nine fuzzy rules using BI-RADS, Shape and Margin attributes, respectively: 1. if BI-RADS is very large and Shape is very large and Margin is very large then Malign; 2. if BI-RADS is very large and Shape is very large and Margin is medium then Malign; 3. if BI-RADS is very large and Shape is large and Margin is small then Malign; 4. if BI-RADS is very large and Shape is large and Margin is medium then Malign; 5. if BI-RADS is very large and Shape is large and Margin is very large then Malign; 6. if BI-RADS is very large and Shape is small then Malign; 7. if BI-RADS is medium then Benign; 8. if BI-RADS is small then Benign; 9. if BI-RADS is large then Benign.</sentence>

  <section name="Design of Ex-DBC system">
    <sentence>As this application is designed to be used by doctors, who are not advanced computer users, we aimed to develop the user interface of the breast cancer as user friendly.</sentence>
    <sentence>The program has been implemented in Visual C# (microsoft visual studio 2005 developer tool) and SQL server 2005 was used as a database platform.</sentence>
    <sentence>Ex-DBC runs on windows environment.</sentence>
    <sentence>We constructed a database for Ex-DBC system in which the detailed information of each patient would be kept.</sentence>
    <sentence>Patient number that is given to each patient for the differentiation, name and surname, medical values belongs to the patient, the doctor’s diagnosis field, the Ex-DBC’s diagnosis field and real diagnosis field is placed in database.</sentence>
    <sentence>Fig 2 shows how Ex-DBC system and its inference engine were designed.</sentence>
    <sentence>Besides, real malignant cell images were used on background of screens in this design.</sentence>
    <sentence>The design of Ex-DBC system Fig 2.</sentence>
    <sentence>The design of Ex-DBC system.</sentence>
    <sentence>Firstly, it is met with an entrance screen when Ex-DBC system runs.</sentence>
    <sentence>User enters his/her own user name and password.</sentence>
    <sentence>If the user has not been defined in the system or makes a wrong entrance then it does not allow access and gives a warning.</sentence>
    <sentence>Some explanatory information related to the system appears on screen after entrance.</sentence>
    <sentence>Later, process selection screen, main menu of Ex-DBC system is visible (Fig 3).</sentence>
    <sentence>A lot of processes deal with data base, diagnose and education displays on this menu.</sentence>
    <sentence>More a lot about these processes will be mentioned in followings.</sentence>
    <sentence>Process selection screen Fig 3.</sentence>
    <sentence>Process selection screen.</sentence>
    <sentence>There are seven processes on this menu: 1.</sentence>
    <sentence>Individually inquire.</sentence>
    <sentence>Data base evaluation.</sentence>
    <sentence>Data base and process.</sentence>
    <sentence>Mammography processing.</sentence>
    <sentence>Compare diagnosis.</sentence>
    <sentence>User and authority.</sentence>
    <sentence>User and password.</sentence>
    <sentence>Each user can use processes inside him/her self authority defined by the system administrator.</sentence>
    <sentence>For instance, when an unauthorized user tries to enter the Data Base and Process screen, the system warns user and does not allow any access.</sentence>
    <sentence>Exit button on the menu screen closes all open processes in the system.</sentence>
    <sentence>Individually inquire In this process, diagnosis of breast cancer could realized by entering only mammographic mass data belong to one patient without recording the patient’s information in database (Fig 4).</sentence>
    <sentence>These data are BI-RADS, patient’s age, mass shape, mass margin, and mass density.</sentence>
    <sentence>Individually inquire screen Fig 4.</sentence>
    <sentence>Individually inquire screen.</sentence>
    <sentence>Data base evaluation Evaluation of diagnosis can be made for all patients recorded in Ex-DBC database.</sentence>
    <sentence>Primarily, all patients who have been recorded in the system database can be attainable from this screen, When the diagnose button is pushed, the list of results for desired patients can be seen on the screen straightaway (Fig 5).</sentence>
    <sentence>In addition, statistical information deals with batch evaluation such as number of benign and malign case and total case can be seen at the top of this screen.</sentence>
    <sentence>Data base evaluation screen Fig 5.</sentence>
    <sentence>Data base evaluation screen.</sentence>
    <sentence>Data base and process Only authorized user can use this process.</sentence>
    <sentence>The list of entire patient is placed in the table at the bottom of the screen.</sentence>
    <sentence>The user can select one of patients by clicking in the table and this patient’s information can be retrieved in above section.</sentence>
    <sentence>In other words diagnosis and updating is attainable from this section.</sentence>
    <sentence>Keeping the patient records, entrance of a new patient, searching for an already recorded patient or extracting a patient from the registration are some of the operations that leads to the construction of a database.</sentence>
    <sentence>The user can perform all these operations by specially prepared this selection (Fig 6).</sentence>
    <sentence>Data base and process screen Fig 6.</sentence>
    <sentence>Data base and process screen.</sentence>
    <sentence>Mammography processing The entire patients are seen in the table at the bottom of this screen.</sentence>
    <sentence>At the same time, the user can examine any patient’s mammography image by clicking related patient record.</sentence>
    <sentence>The user can enlarge this image for numbers of times by pushing enlarge button (Fig 7).</sentence>
    <sentence>In addition, if it is essential, the image can be opened with image processing program such as Photoshop and Macromedia Fireworks.</sentence>
    <sentence>In this way, the user can one by one examine the mammography images comprehensively.</sentence>
    <sentence>Mammography processing screen Fig 7.</sentence>
    <sentence>Mammography processing screen.</sentence>
    <sentence>Compare diagnosis This process has been designed as education aimed in diagnosis breast cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>Randomly selected medical data belongs to each patient is showed here and Ex-DBC system wants user to diagnose all patient or patients selected by educator.</sentence>
    <sentence>As a result Ex-DBC system compares user diagnosis with self diagnosis and real diagnosis if it is previously entered in system and this statistical evaluation is showed at the bottom of the screen.</sentence>
    <sentence>Ex-DBC system structure is extremely user friendly as it is easy to navigate with its wizard-like interface (Fig 8).</sentence>
    <sentence>Compare diagnosis screen Fig 8.</sentence>
    <sentence>Compare diagnosis screen.</sentence>
    <sentence>User and authority Only the most authorized user can enter in here.</sentence>
    <sentence>This user defines other user and their authorities.</sentence>
    <sentence>Thanks to this process, existing authorities for users can be limited or completely deleted.</sentence>
    <sentence>User and password All users can change own passwords by using this process.</sentence>

  <section name="Diagnostic power of Ex-DBC system">
    <sentence>Diagnosis is an essential step in medical care.</sentence>
    <sentence>Usually this involves ‘diagnostic tests’ of some description.</sentence>
    <sentence>A health check is also a group of diagnostic tests.</sentence>
    <sentence>Decisions about medical treatment are made on the basis of test results.</sentence>
    <sentence>These tests are sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values.</sentence>
    <sentence>Diagnostic test results of Ex-DBC were given in this section.</sentence>
    <sentence>Definitions Sensitivity: Sensitivity of a test is the percentage of all patients with disease present who have a positive test.</sentence>
    <sentence>Specificity: Specificity of a test is the percentage of all patients without disease who have a negative test.</sentence>
    <sentence>Predictive value: The predictive value of a test is a measure (%) of the times that the value (positive or negative) is the true value, i.e.</sentence>
    <sentence>the percent of all positive tests that are true positives is the positive predictive value.</sentence>
    <sentence>An ideal, or truly accurate, test will always give a positive result with disease, and a negative result without disease.</sentence>
    <sentence>This is not the case for all tests.</sentence>
    <sentence>In practice this means that not all positive test results will represent disease.</sentence>
    <sentence>This is described by the positive predictive value (PPV).</sentence>
    <sentence>Equally, not all negative results will represent no disease.</sentence>
    <sentence>This is described by the negative predictive value (NPV).</sentence>
    <sentence>The simple two-by-two table is one of the most intuitive methods for the analysis of diagnostic examinations (Moskowitz, 1992).</sentence>
    <sentence>Despite this, the method is capable of displaying strength and power in illuminating understanding the performance and analysis of diagnostic examinations.</sentence>
    <sentence>The basic idea of a diagnostic test interpretation is to calculate the probability a patient has a disease under consideration given a certain test result.</sentence>
    <sentence>For this, a two-by-two table is used as a mnemonic device (Langlotz, 2003).</sentence>
    <sentence>The table is labeled with the test results on the left side and the disease status on top as shown in Table 2.</sentence>
    <sentence>Table 2.</sentence>
    <sentence>The two-by-two table.</sentence>
    <sentence>Test T (Ex-DBC) Disease present D+ Disease absent D− Total Test positive (T+) True positives (TP = 286) False positive (FP = 12) 298 Test negative (T−) False negative (FN = 91) True negatives (TN = 381) 472 Total 377 393 770 Table 2 shows a fictitious data from an experiment to evaluate the accuracy of a certain test T for a certain set of patients with clinical suspicions.</sentence>
    <sentence>The data are numbers of women with malignant or benign breast tumors.</sentence>
    <sentence>Referring to the table, the sensitivity and specificity of the two-by-two table may be illustrated.</sentence>
    <sentence>By using the numbers in the “Malignant” column, the sensitivity of a fictitious test T in the sample of women is 0.76% (286 out of 377) and specificity of test T is calculated as 0.97% (381 negative results out of 393 women with benign lesions).</sentence>
    <sentence>Sensitivity Specificity Positive predictive value (PPV) Negative predictive value (NPV)</sentence>
  </section>
  <section name="Discussion and conclusion">
    <sentence>Most of the work on diagnosis breast cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>Some of these works aim at detecting one or more of the three abnormal structures in mammograms (Comer, Liu, &amp; Delp, 1996): microcalcifications (Strickland &amp; Hahn, 1996), circumscribed masses (Giger et al., 1990) and speculated lesions (Liu &amp; Delp, 1997).</sentence>
    <sentence>Other methods depend on classifying the breast lesions as benign or malignant (Brzakovic, Luo, &amp; Brzakovic, 1990).</sentence>
    <sentence>There are problems with the subjective analysis of mammographic images by experience of the human operator, but it is also affected by fatigue and other human-related factors.</sentence>
    <sentence>In addition, the interpretation is a repetitive task that requires lot of attention to minute details.</sentence>
    <sentence>Hence, it requires lot of staff time and effort, which results in slowing the diagnosis time.</sentence>
    <sentence>On the other hand, the objective analysis of mammograms, which is carried out by automated systems, provides consistent performance but its accuracy is usually lower.</sentence>
    <sentence>Due to the sensitivity of this problem, we believe that radiologists should be involved and computers should not replace them completely.</sentence>
    <sentence>However, computer systems can help them perform better by enhancing the quality of images, highlighting the suspicious regions and providing better analysis tools.</sentence>
    <sentence>Ng, Peh, Fok, Sim, and Ng (2002) proposed an expert system based on the interpretation of mammographic and ultrasound images that may be used by expert and non-expert doctors in the interpretation and classifying of patient cases.</sentence>
    <sentence>The expert system software consists of a mammographic (MAMMEX) and breast ultrasound (SOUNDEX) medical expert systems which may be used to deduce cases according to the Breast Imaging Recording and Data System (BI-RADS) based upon patients’ history, physical and clinical assessment as well as mammograms and breast ultrasound images.</sentence>
    <sentence>High quality mammogram images are high resolution and large size images.</sentence>
    <sentence>Processing these images require high computational capabilities.</sentence>
    <sentence>The transmission of these images over the net is sometimes critical especially if the diagnosis of remote radiologists is required.</sentence>
    <sentence>AbuBaker, Qahwaji, Aqel, Al-Osta, and Saleh (2006) introduced a preprocessing technique for reducing the size and enhancing the quality of USF and MIAS mammogram images.</sentence>
    <sentence>The algorithm analyses the mammogram image to determine if 16-bit to 8-bit conversion process is required.</sentence>
    <sentence>Enhancement is applied later followed by a scaling process to reduce the mammogram size.</sentence>
    <sentence>The performances of the algorithms are evaluated objectively and subjectively.</sentence>
    <sentence>On average 87% reduction in size is obtained with no loss of data at the breast region.</sentence>
    <sentence>Elter, Schulz-Wendtland, and Wittenberg (2007) presented two novel CAD approaches that both emphasize an intelligible decision process to predict breast biopsy outcomes from BI-RADS™ findings.</sentence>
    <sentence>An intelligible reasoning process is an important requirement for the acceptance of CAD systems by physicians.</sentence>
    <sentence>The first approach induces a global model based on decision-tree learning.</sentence>
    <sentence>The second approach is based on case-based reasoning and applies an entropic similarity measure.</sentence>
    <sentence>They have evaluated the performance of both CAD approaches on two large publicly available mammography reference databases using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, bootstrap sampling, and the ANOVA statistical significance test.</sentence>
    <sentence>Both approaches outperform the diagnosis decisions of the physicians.</sentence>
    <sentence>Hence, both systems have the potential to reduce the number of unnecessary breast biopsies in clinical practice.</sentence>
    <sentence>A comparison of the performance of the proposed decision tree and CBR approaches with a state of the art approach based on artificial neural networks (ANN) shows that the CBR approach performs slightly better than the ANN approach, which in turn results in slightly better performance than the decision-tree approach.</sentence>
    <sentence>Differentiating between benign and malignant mammographic findings is difficult.</sentence>
    <sentence>Only 15–30% of biopsies performed on nonpalpable but mammographically suspicious lesions prove malignant (Hall, Storella, Silverstone, &amp; Wyshak, 1988).</sentence>
    <sentence>The high number of unnecessary breast biopsies causes major mental and physical discomfort for the patients as well as unnecessary expenses spent for examinations.</sentence>
    <sentence>Therefore, the aim of Ex-DBC is to make these human errors minimum by catching and interpreting points that may be unrecognized by the radiologist.</sentence>
    <sentence>For this, the artificial intelligence technology to be used in Ex-DBC has strong inference engine that can detect hidden relations in the case unrecognized by the human expert.</sentence>
    <sentence>Ex-DBC system will be an innovative approach in diagnosis of breast cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>Besides, in the current study developed Ex-DBC system has high positive predictive rate (96%) and specificity (97%) for breast cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>Thus, this model can provide significant contributes to prevent unnecessary biopsy in diagnosis of breast cancer.</sentence>
    <sentence>Besides it can be benefited from this system for training of students in medicine.</sentence>
