This paper propses an extremum seeking control scheme based on particle swarm optimization (PSO).
The system states are steered to the optimal point by the controller, and the explicit form of the performance function is not needed.
We also propose an reshuffle-then-insertion algorithm to reduce the regulator gain and osillation induced by population-based stochastic searching algorithms.
