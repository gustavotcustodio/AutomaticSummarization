We develop a fuzzy logic controller to to add intelligence to the ECM process.
We built an experimental ECM drilling rig that demonstrates the improvement through the integration of a fuzzy logic controller into the existing control system.
Proposed model allows for “human like” decision-making intelligence to be incorporated into this manufacturing process.
The proposed system is proven to be highly adaptive and accurate.
