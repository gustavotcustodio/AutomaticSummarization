The paper focuses on improving the standalone low-cost INS accuracy.
Random forest regression based model is proposed to improve the INS positioning accuracy.
Proposed model is shown to perform better than existing neural network model.
A total of 24â€“56% of improvement in the positional accuracy was observed.
Proposed model is applicable to land vehicle navigation where low-cost INS is utilized.
