GARCH models have been complemented with Neural Networks to better model and forecast volatility in highly fluctuating market.
The volatility estimates, other explanatory variables and simulated volatility series have been used as inputs to characterize the statistical properties of the volatility series.
The computational results on S&P 500 show that such hybrid models provide significantly better volatility forecasts.
Further applications of such volatility forecasts in various financial engineering problems would be interesting.
