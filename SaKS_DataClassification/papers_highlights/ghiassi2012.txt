We introduce the dynamic artificial neural network (DAN2) for text classification.
DN2 is a scalable algorithm, not requiring user defined configuration.
DAN2 is compared with k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
DAN2 is shown to outperform both kNN and SVM with this data set.
