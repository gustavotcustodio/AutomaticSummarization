We use decision tree models to classify patients according to their criticality.
Various data preprocessing and modeling activities are carried out to reduce features from data set.
Different decision tree models are generated by considering equal and unequal instance distribution from classes.
Performance improves if we consider equal distribution of instances from each class.
