Lexicographic bottleneck mixed-model assembly line balancing problem is studied.
Artificial bee colony and tabu search algorithms are proposed.
Parameters of the proposed algorithms are optimised using response surface method.
Test problems are solved to assess the performance of the proposed methods.
It is observed that both algorithms provide promising results in reasonable times.
