This paper presents a new approach to estimate unstable flame dynamics.
Computer vision processed images from CCD cameras provide a discriminant characteristic vector.
A four-degree-of-freedom second order model is identified through Operational Modal Analysis.
Unstable and stable flame models are cross-validated through spectral analysis.
The method is capable of predicting flame extinction.
