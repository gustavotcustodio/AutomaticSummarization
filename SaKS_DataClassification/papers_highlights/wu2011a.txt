A course timetabling system is implemented in the CLIPS language.
Because the CLIPS inference is time consuming, the rules are inferred in parallel.
Improper division of rules can result in a false conclusion or runtime errors.
Two possible problems caused by improper rule division are identified.
Three partitioning guidelines are then used to cope with these problems.
