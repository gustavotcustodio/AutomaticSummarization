We formulated hybrid harmony search with swarm intelligence (HHS) for solving non-convex problem.
The proposed algorithm applied to dynamic economic dispatch to minimize the fuel cost of generators over the scheduling horizon.
The HHS algorithm applied to 5 units, 10 units and 30 units system and compared with other reported results.
The convergence and robustness of HHS algorithm is better than other reported algorithm.
