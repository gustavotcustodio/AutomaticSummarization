The transit network design problem with simultaneous frequency setting is considered in the paper.
Greedy heuristic and Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) metaheuristic are developed for the problem considered.
The numerical experiments are performed on the well-known benchmark problem.
The proposed model outperformed the other models known from the literature.
