We propose a new path planning algorithm based on the use of Q-learning and artificial neural networks.
We analyze and model in VR the mobile robot PowerBot.
We implement and test the proposed algorithm in both VR and real workspaces.
The solution converges to collision-free trajectories in dynamic environments.
