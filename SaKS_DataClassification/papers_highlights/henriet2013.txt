We developed a Case-Based Reasoning system for Health Science which is able to create prototypes of human lungs.
We used Artificial Neural Networks in the adaptation phase of this Case-Based Reasoning system.
We studied a general strategy to optimise accuracies of adapted solutions based on the optimisation of the training sets of interpolation tools.
